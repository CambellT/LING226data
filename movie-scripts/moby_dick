MOBY DICK
PART ONE
ACT 1
TITLES OVER:
EXT. NANTUCKET HEADLANDS - EVENING
Majestic black cliffs tower over the rocky coastline of
the Atlantic seaboard. A stormy winter sky. Dwarfed by
this mighty vista, a speck of a man descends toward the
grey vastness of the ocean.
EXT. NANTUCKET SHORELINE - EVENING
Powerful waves crash against coastal rocks. ISHMAEL
(late 20's), an inquisitive young man with an amiable, intelligent
face, ventures along a beachside trail
against the beating wind, toting a small satchel.
EXT. NANTUCKET -EVENING
An 1850's whaling seaport. Muddy streets and an old,
rain-slicked dock. A cold, stark, unforgiving place.
Tall-masted ships sway beside the dock, wind buffeting
their furled rigging. In b.g., a glimpse of a dramatic
sunset between darkening thunderheads.
EXT. DOCKSIDE SHEDS - EVENING
THREE NANTUCKET WOMEN in dark clothes and shawls collect baskets
from a storage shed, their faces etched by years
of hardship and woe. A look of widows about them.
Ishmael passes before them, and we follow him through
a clutter of barrels and ship refuse into town.
EXT. NANTUCKET STREET - EVENING
A short block of brick houses and taverns. A FEW PEOPLE
scurry about, hugging buildings to escape the storm.
2.
Ishmael bundles along the sidewalk, drawn to the warm
glow of oil lamps behind thick-paned windows.
Across the street, ELIJAH, a stooped, scrawny old man
wrapped in a tattered oilskin cape, watches Ishmael with
demented eyes, muttering to himself.
Ishmael pauses under a tavern sign with a harpoon crucifix, "THE
CROSSED HARPOONS". He peers through the window:
INT. THE CROSSED HARPOONS -EVENING
Shabby but lively, a loud revelry in progress.
EXT. NANTUCKET STREET -EVENING
As Ishmael looks in, the tavern door swings open. A
jovial, barrel-chested man (STUBB) clamors out with
TWO DOXIES in each arm, laughing spiritedly. Ishmael
backs up against the window to steer clear. Stubb and
his prostitutes bustle off into the stormy night.
Ishmael considers the tavern and digs out a few meager
coins from his pocket. Someone distracts him:
Crazy, old Elijah eyeballs him from across the street.
Ishmael reacts and protectively pockets his coins. He
moves on.
A short distance further, another tavern with a sign
overhead, swinging in the wind: "THE SPOUTER-INN,
PETER COFFIN, PROPRIETOR". Ishmael glances through
the window.
INT. SPOUTER INN - EVENING
Shabbier than the last inn, poorly lit.
EXT. NANTUCKET STREET - EVENING
Ishmael nods to himself. Perfect. He steps inside,
as lightning flashes and thunder CRACKS behind him.
Elijah suddenly appears at the window, the lightning
3.
reflecting his wild eyes. Staring inside, he licks his
lips for want of a drink then wraps his cape around
himself to stave off the windy chill. He wanders off, babbling
incoherently.
INT. SPOUTER INN -EVENING
A deserted anteroom. VOICES drift in from a rear dining
room, its doorway framed by a huge whale jawbone.
Ishmael drops his satchel, removes his coat and hangs it
on a rack. He stops to notice a painting on a dark wall.
Trying to make out its massive center image, Ishmael draws closer
to focus on the eye of a mammoth sperm whale:
A terrifying depiction of a monstrous leviathan, leaping
over a ship's tall masts.
Ishmael is transfixed by it. A voice startles him:
COFFIN (O.S.)
Goin' to sea, are ye?
PETER COFFIN, the stout tavern owner, appears in the
jawbone doorway and looks him over amusedly. Ishmael
smiles eagerly and steps over to the inn counter.
ISHMAEL
Aye, that I am.
Moving behind the counter, Coffin turns the registration
book around, takes a pen and dips it into an inkwell.
COFFIN
Ship's mate, I suppose?
ISHMAEL
No.
He takes the pen and signs his name, Coffin watching him.
COFFIN
A passenger, then?
ISHMAEL
Not very likely. A passenger
needs a wallet, and that's
just a slice of leather when
4.
there's nothing in it.
COFFIN
A commodore, then? Or a cook?
Ishmael laughs. As if echoing him, a GUST OF LAUGHTER
blows in from the dining room.
ISHMAEL
No, a simple sailor, jumping
from spar to spar like a
grasshopper in a May meadow...
like a slave you might say,
but who isn't a slave? Tell
me that?
COFFIN
I suppose then you're goin'
whalin'?
ISHMAEL
Aye! Might ye have a room
then for a simple sailor,
Mister...Coffin, is it?
COFFIN
Aye. If ye got no objection
to sharin' a blanket with a
simple harpooner.
ISHMAEL
Harpooner? Well...I'd rather
put up with half any decent
man's blanket than wander
further on so bitter a night.
Another GALE OF LAUGHTER from the dining area. Ishmael
peers curiously around the counter to see the doorway:
A room filled with bawdy, gruff-looking men. Standing
close by the doorway is FLASK, a short, pugnacious
mariner in a restless mood.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Could that be him, sir? The
harpooner you mentioned?
COFFIN
No...that's Mister Flask,
with the rest of the Grampus
5.
crew. Just landed. Liquor's
already gone to their heads!
Flask quickly takes his leave and crosses the anteroom
toward the front door. Coffin chuckles at him:
COFFIN (cont'd)
Off lookin' to board another
ship, are ye, Flask?
Flask nods with a haughty sneer, glancing over Ishmael.
He swaggers out without a word.
COFFIN (cont'd)
Well, that's that. As I
expected. He's already sick
of solid ground. Burns his
feet, it does. Firm land,
I mean.
INT. SPOUTER INN HALLWAY -EVENING
Oil lamp in hand, Coffin leads Ishmael through a narrow,
twisty corridor of labyrinthine turns and steps.
Up three steps and down, around a corner and over another
set of steps, passing dim-lit doors. Coffin walks fast, Ishmael
struggling to keep up. As they pass one door...
A giggling, half-naked girl (one of Stubb's Doxies)
spills out. Stubb yanks her back inside, slams the door.
Ishmael pauses to look back, puzzling over their MUFFLED LAUGHTER.
Coffin glances back with a chortle.
COFFIN
That Mister Stubb ain't seen
a skirt in narry two years.
(waves him on)
Step lively, lad, I haven't
got all night.
INT. SPOUTER INN ROOM -EVENING
The door opens into a dark room with sparse furnishings
and a modest-sized bed. Coffin lights an oil lamp.
COFFIN
This whale oil's gettin' a
6.
bit low. I'd best refill
it tomorrow...
Ishmael regards the bed ambivalently.
ISHMAEL
Seems a trifle small for two
grown men.
COFFIN
Well, if you're goin' to go
whalin', ye better get used
to that sort of thing. Why,
look at that bed! It's the
largest one in the house!
Sal and me slept in that bed
the night we were spliced.
Plenty of room...
ISHMAEL
Mind ye, I'm not complaining,
Mister Coffin...I'd just like
to know what kind of man I'd
be sharing it with.
COFFIN
Well, it's almost Sunday.
That harpooner likely anchored
somewhere else for the night.
Make yerself comfortable,
Mister...what's yer name?
Ishmael turns an innocent smile.
ISHMAEL
Call me...Ishmael.
Coffin nods and exits, closing the door behind him.
Ishmael gazes around the room. In a corner sits a
giant sea chest with mysterious, painted designs.
Pondering it, Ishmael takes off his boots and pants,
crawls under the bed's blanket and leans toward the
bedside oil lamp. He blows it out.
EXT. CAPTAIN AHAB'S HOME -NIGHT
Lightning illuminates a two-story brick house on the
outskirts of town. Lamplights burn behind the windows
7.
of both floors.
Passing before the second-floor light, a man's shadow
paces back and forth with feverish intensity.
INT. CAPTAIN AHAB'S HOME -NIGHT
A lamp casts a shuddery glow over a pale, haggard
woman (AHAB'S WIFE) who sits before the dying embers
of a hearth, wrapped in a woolen shawl. Close beside
her sits a timid, 12-year-old boy (AHAB'S SON),
slight of build with an angelic face.
Eyes turned to the ceiling, both listen apprehensively
to a METHODIC, DRY THUNK on the wood floor upstairs,
pacing relentlessly...the FOOTFALLS OF A PEG LEG.
A LOUD KNOCK at the door -- the two jump out of their
skins. Upstairs, the PACING STOPS. Unmoving, the Wife
stares at the door. A tense beat.
Another UNSETTLING KNOCK. The Wife nervously fingers
her shawl. The Son sits rigidly. Both waiting...
ANGLE ON a staircase, the top half blocked from view
by a wooden overhang. From the top of the stairs, a
steady THUNK-CLOP, THUNK-CLOP. Finally, a foot steps
down into view...then a white whale-bone peg leg. It
descends slowly and painfully, as we see elaborate
leather straps connecting it to a severed thigh.
The Wife and Son watch with fear, mesmerized.
On the staircase, a man's chest lowers into view...
then the face of CAPTAIN AHAB. A face of fury and
power, molded in bronze, eyes black as night.
A long white scar streaks down from his bald crown
to his collar. A fierce visage set in granite.
A third BOOMING KNOCK at the door. Ahab glances
at his wife and child, his expression unchanged.
The anxious-faced Wife trembles.
Dragging his peg leg to the door with agonizing
THUNKS, Ahab opens it into the night...
An icy GUST sweeps inside -- the lamp flickers out,
cinder sparks fly from the hearth!
8.
Silhouetted against the harsh storm, FIVE GHOSTLY
FIGURES fill the doorway. Their faces unseen, one
with a turbaned head. A lightning flash gives us
a quick glimpse -- sinister, demonic Arab faces.
EXT. NANTUCKET STREET -LATE NIGHT
Few lights are still burning, the storm died down.
The street is obscured by fog.
A tall figure (QUEEQUEG) looms in the fog, carrying
a lethal-looking harpoon like a shepherd's staff.
He struts his way toward the Spouter Inn.
INT. SPOUTER INN ROOM -LATE NIGHT
In bed, Ishmael arouses from deep slumber, sensing
something. Then he settles back to sleep.
INT. SPOUTER INN HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT
Viewed from Ishmael's door, the tall, ominous figure
lumbers down the dark hall toward us.
INT. SPOUTER INN ROOM - LATE NIGHT
Ishmael is startled awake by a LOUD CREAK of the door.
He peeks out of the covers.
The tall figure enters and leans his immense harpoon
gently against a wall, as if it were delicate china.
He lights a small candle on a dresser.
A dark-skinned Polynesian, Queequeg's clean-shaved face
is covered with strange, exotic tattoos. His face is
ferocious-looking and yet tranquil, almost innocent in character.
He pulls a satchel off his shoulder, opens
it and takes out what vaguely resembles a doll's head.
Obscure in the dim light, Ishmael watches in awe.
It's a shrunken human head. Queequeg lifts it up to
the candlelight and chants some indecipherable words
to it.
Ishmael stares warily from his covers.
9.
Queequeg abruptly stops his invocation, stuffs the head
back into his satchel and moves the candle to the bedside
table. He quickly undresses.
Ishmael can't take his eyes off the muscular, tattooed
body -- as Queequeg leaps into the bed beside him.
Still unaware of Ishmael's presence, Queequeg produces
a long tomahawk pipe, leans toward the candle, lights
the pipe and sits back in bed, puffing serenely.
He rests his free hand down next to him...directly onto Ishmael's
face.
Ishmael stiffens with fear. Queequeg freezes. Ishmael
tries to jump out of bed -- but Queequeg grabs him by his
nightshirt collar and firmly holds him down. He deftly
wields his tomahawk, its blade against Ishmael's throat.
QUEEQUEG
Who de debel is you?! You
don't speak up, I kill-e!
Ishmael gapes up in strangled terror, gasping.
ISHMAEL
(cries out)
Landlord! Mister Coffin!
Queequeg's frown tightens, though somehow more curious
than angry. He presses the blade of the tomahawk harder against
Ishmael's throat and growls:
QUEEQUEG
Speak! Tell-ee me who ye be
or, dam-me, I kill-ee!
The door to the room flies open. Coffin steps quickly
inside. An amused smile, as he feigns concern.
COFFIN
Look here, Queequeg, stop
that!
Queequeg turns his attention to Coffin, just long enough
for Ishmael to wriggle away. Ishmael scrambles out of
the bed, outraged, to Coffin:
ISHMAEL
10.
Why didn't you tell me this...
harpooner I'm sharing a bed
with is a bleedin' CANNIBAL,
for Christ's sake?!
Coffin pays no attention to Ishmael as he faces Queequeg.
COFFIN
Queequeg, listen to me...you
sabbee me, I sabbee you, no?
Queequeg nods thoughtfully. He lights his tomahawk pipe,
smoke enveloping his tattooed face.
COFFIN
This man sleep here in this
bed. With you, you sabbee?
Queequeg nods again. He looks at Ishmael, who stares
with open dismay at this immense Polynesian harpooner.
QUEEQUEG
Me sabbee plenty.
(points at Ishmael)
You get-ee in.
Ishmael glances at Coffin, who grins and nods at the
bed. Queequeg, smiling good-heartedly, hands his pipe
to Ishmael. Hesitating but more relaxed, Ishmael takes
it and draws a mouthful of smoke. And promptly gags.
Tears and coughing. Queequeg laughs, loud and hard.
EXT. NANTUCKET HARBOR DOCK -LATE NIGHT
The storm over, the harbor is silent and deathly still.
The dock is dense with fog.
Amidst a dockside rubble of discarded sails, old Elijah
half-sleeps fitfully, huddled under a filthy sailcloth, covered
in frost.
GROUPED FOOTSTEPS startles him wide awake. Among them,
the unmistakable SOUND of a PEG LEG STRIKING STONE.
Elijah stares out with troubled dread:
Like apparitions of the night, six dark shapes materialize
out of the fog and march toward a docked, three-masted
11.
whaling ship. The Pequod. They strut inexorably up the gangplank,
their central figure's STEPS bold and clear. THUNK-CLOP,
THUNK-CLOP...
FADE OUT.
ACT 2
INT. SPOUTER INN ROOM -MORNING
Cold sunlight peeks into the room from the only window. Queequeg
sleeps, his arm wrapped around Ishmael's chest. Ishmael lies
awake, immobilized by Queequeg's unconscious embrace.
ISHMAEL
Queequeg!
A loud snore. Ishmael puts some serious effort into trying
to liberate himself, to no avail.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
(louder)
Queequeg...wake up, ye big,
savage oaf! In the name of
goodness...WAKE UP!
He writhes, pushes and strains his way free of the giant harpooner,
who slowly wakes. Ishmael drops his feet to
the floor and shakes his head. To himself:
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Must be dreamin' of his savage
wife, back in whatever savage
place he escaped from!
Queequeg's eyes open. He grins at Ishmael, yawns and
leaps out of bed with amazing agility.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Good morning to ye too, big
king of the typhoon snore...
Ishmael stares with bewilderment at his brown torso,
covered with tattoos from head to toe. Queequeg's grin
is friendly, as though he were used to being gawked at.
INT. SPOUTER INN DINING ROOM -MORNING
A vast platter of steaming steaks is plopped down on a
12.
large table by a stout, red-faced woman, SAL COFFIN.
As soon as the platter is on the table, the sharp
spear of a harpoon stabs a fat cut of bloody red meat.
Queequeg transfers the steak to his plate with quiet
ceremony, the entire maneuver performed with exquisite gentleness
and good manners. Setting aside his harpoon
on the floor, he digs in.
Ishmael watches him, baffled. The rest of the men
don't seem to have noticed anything unusual. They
reach for meat and bread, far less politely, and
noisily chow down. A brown and brawny bunch, Stubb
and Flask among them. Ishmael glances behind him:
BULKINGTON, a handsome, stalwart seaman with a quiet
reserve, sits at another table with his young, pretty
FIANCEE. They talk in low voices, holding hands.
Ishmael turns back...the platter of steaks is almost
empty. He takes the last cut, a small, overcooked
portion. Studies it with resignation. He's about
to cut into it, when his steak is removed by Sal...
She grins and presents him with a whole new platter
piled high with fine, rare slices. Stubb and Flask
chuckle at Ishmael. Sal gives them a stern look.
SAL
What're YOU laughin' at, ye
chowder-headed bumpkins?!
(to Ishmael)
Eat, young man! No one here's
in a more privileged position
than any other. Ye haven't gone
to sea yet, have ye? Out there
a lowly sailor's got to wait for
a second mate to help himself...
(pokes at Stubb)
...like this boobie here! Or
he's got to wait for this greasy
baboon of a third mate HERE!
She give Flask a nudge, knocking the cap off his head.
SAL (cont'd)
But not in MY establishment!
(back to Ishmael)
So eat, laddie! Eat!
13.
ISHMAEL
Yes indeed, ma'am!
He reaches enthusiastically for the platter, Stubb and
Flask laughing heartily at him.
Queequeg stabs up a steak with his harpoon and drops
it on Ishmael's plate with a big grin. Ishmael smiles
back, getting used to his new friend.
EXT. NANTUCKET STREET -DAY
A clear, crisp winter day on the now crowded street.
Ishmael and Queequeg emerge from the Spouter Inn, Ishmael pushing
an old wheelbarrow piled up with his satchel and Queequeg's sea
chest.
Puffing on his tomahawk, Queequeg reaches into his bag
and produces the shrunken head. Ishmael reacts, glancing around
self-consciously.
ISHMAEL
Queequeg, put that thing
away! These good Nantucket
Christians will take you for
the devil himself.
QUEEQUEG
(puzzledly)
Why do-ee say?
ISHMAEL
For God's sake, it's a man's
head! A very dead real man,
too! Nantucketers don't carry
the dead around in their bags!
They bury 'em, don't ye know
that?
QUEEQUEG
Aye! Nantucketers buy-em too,
I tell-ee! For many coins!
However, Queequeg puts away the head. He withdraws a
wooden statuette from his bag and gestures over it.
QUEEQUEG
Me Yojo tell-ee what ship
14.
Queequeg and-ee ship out on!
He sabbee! Yojo and-ee,
sabbee?
Ishmael looks down at the statuette, then inquisitively
at Queequeg.
ISHMAEL
You're sayin' your...Yojo
wants ME to choose a ship?
Is that what you mean?
QUEEQUEG
Aye.
ISHMAEL
Will ye be shippin' out with
me then? Is that what you're
trying to tell me, Queequeg?
Queequeg nods with a bright grin, his sharpened teeth
white as snow. He reaches into his bag again and brings
out a handful of coins. Dropping them unceremoniously
to the ground, he stops and crouches there.
Ishmael stops and sets down the wheelbarrow, watching
him curiously.
Queequeg divides the coins into two separate piles,
pockets half of them, then stands and plops the other
half into Ishmael's hand.
Ishmael doesn't understand, but Queequeg has already
turned away to continue on down the street. Ishmael
grabs the barrow and catches up to him.
ISHMAEL
Queequeg! Wait, stop...AVAST
there, mate!
Queequeg stops and waits, puffing patiently on his pipe.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Listen, my friend...this is
simply out of the question!
What the devil is the matter
with ye?!
A puzzled, hurt look from Queequeg.
15.
QUEEQUEG
Ee don't want ship out wid
Queequeg?
Ishmael tries to hand the coins back to Queequeg, who
ignores the gesture, waiting for an answer.
ISHMAEL
No...I mean yes, of course
I will! What I mean is...
YOU'RE better suited to pick
out a whaler best fitted to
carry us, not I.
(pushes coins back)
And I shall certainly not
take your money!
Not looking at the coins, Queequeg thoughtfully exhales
smoke, trying to understand.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Listen, Queequeg...I fear I
must make a confession.
(leans closer)
I used to be a school teacher.
D'ye know what that is?
QUEEQUEG
Aye. Missionary.
ISHMAEL
Well, not exactly. What I'm
tryin' to say is...I never
jumped a spar in my life.
QUEEQUEG
Ishmael no sailor?
ISHMAEL
(embarrassed)
Aye. Me no sailor. It's
just, ye see...I have this
burnin' desire to go to sea.
Queequeg grins, understanding perfectly. He pats the
satchel with utter confidence.
16.
QUEEQUEG
Yojo sabbee. Ishmael pick
ship.
He takes over the wheelbarrow and pushes on. Ishmael
catches up with him, and the two stride together
toward the port. Ishmael smiles, feeling better now. Queequeg
SINGS a lyrical Polynesian TUNE to himself,
smiling aside at LOCAL CHILDREN, who gawk up at him
as he passes by.
EXT. NANTUCKET DOCK -DAY
At the bustling dockside, the Pequod is being fitted
for a long voyage.
EXT. PEQUOD (DOCKED) - DAY
A short, bent SHIP'S CARPENTER with a wrinkled face
oversees the loading of lumber. His body is wracked
with arthritis, but for his powerful arms and hands.
An old, grizzled SHIP'S COOK watches, as DOCKHANDS
carry food stores and water barrels on deck.
By his side is PIP (12), a black cabin boy of small
stature with a playful face. Merry as a cricket and
bright as a cherub. He toys with a tambourine as he
watches the bustle of activity. A cheerful presence,
clearly appreciated by the men at work.
Overseeing the loading operation from an old wicker
chair by the gangplank is a heavy-set, retired captain,
PELEG, dressed in the Quaker style. He watches with sharp-eyed
care at every passing item, writing them
down on a thick ledger.
The SOUND of Queequeg's powerful CHANTING VOICE wafts
over the dock. SHIP'S CREWMEN steal glances at the
curious duo down below, as they approach.
EXT. NANTUCKET DOCK - DAY
Queequeg ceases his chanting, scanning the contours of
the Pequod's tall masts. Ishmael looks up with him,
studying the old vessel with admiration and curiosity.
ISHMAEL
17.
It's an old ship...preparing
for a long voyage, I gather.
QUEEQUEG
Aye. She be long-seasoned
ship.
ISHMAEL
And covered with whale teeth!
Their eyes lower to the deck, where each bulwark is
decorated with the long sharp teeth of sperm whales,
some used for fastening ropes. Queequeg nods, but
says nothing. Ishmael ponders the whole ship.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
There's something a bit...
melancholy about her, if
you ask me.
As if to contradict him, Pip PLAYS his tambourine and
hums in a light, angelic voice. Queequeg smiles at
him, some vague brotherly connection between them.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Well...I suppose Yojo's made
our choice for us.
He musters courage and struts up the gangplank, trying
to look swarthy. Queequeg waits on the dock, smoking
and leaning on his harpoon, still assessing the Pequod.
EXT. PEQUOD (DOCKED) -DAY
Ishmael stops before Peleg, who barely acknowledges him.
ISHMAEL
Beg pardon, sir? Might this
be the Captain?
Peleg stops writing and faces Ishmael with a closed expression.
PELEG
Supposing it be. What d'ye
want with him?
ISHMAEL
I was thinking of shippin'.
18.
Peleg frowns and looks him over critically.
PELEG
You're no Nantucketer. What
d'ye know about whaling?
ISHMAEL
Nothing, sir, but I want to
see what whaling is. I want
to see the world.
PELEG
(laughs at that)
Can't you see the world from
where ye stand, young man? You
want to see what whaling is, do
ye? Are ye man enough to pitch
a harpoon down a live whale's
throat, then jump after it? Well,
I'll tell ye this much: there's
death in this business, and it
can bundle a man quite quickly
into eternity. Does that
frighten ye?
ISHMAEL
No sir, it does not.
PELEG
I see. Then have ye clapped
eyes yet on Captain Ahab?
A ripple of discreet CHUCKLING from the crewmen nearby.
Pip taps his tambourine forbodingly. Ishmael's puzzled
but remains undaunted.
ISHMAEL
Captain Ahab, sir? Who is
Captain Ahab?
BILDAD, another older gentleman, appears from below deck.
As thin as Peleg is round, he glances over Ishmael with
a dry, tight-lipped expression.
BILDAD
"Who is Ahab?" Who is THIS,
Peleg?
PELEG
19.
He says he's our man, Bildad!
He wants to ship!
BILDAD
Do ye, now?
ISHMAEL
I do! Yessir!
BILDAD
His lungs are sort of soft.
(to Ishmael)
Captain Ahab is the captain
of this ship, young fellow.
ISHMAEL
But I thought I WAS speakin'
to the Captain, sir.
PELEG
You're speaking to Captain
Bildad. I'm Captain Peleg.
We own this fine specimen,
and it's our job to see to
it that she's fitted out
with all her needs...
(a doubtful look)
Including, sir, a crew with
goodly experience.
Frustrated that he's failing this interview , Ishmael
glances back toward Queequeg for support.
EXT. NANTUCKET DOCK - DAY
Queequeg sits on the wheelbarrow of their belongings, obliviously
smoking his tomahawk pipe.
EXT. PEQUOD (DOCKED) - DAY
On his own, Ishmael turns back to Peleg.
ISHMAEL
Where IS this Captain Ahab,
20.
sir?
PELEG
What do ye want with him?
ISHMAEL
To see him. I'd like to...
see him.
The men at work now slow their pace, eavesdropping.
Pip rattles his tambourine at an ominous tempo, until
the Cook gestures him to cease.
PELEG
That's highly unlikely. He
won't always see me, so I
rather doubt he'll see you!
A strange man, he is indeed...
(to Bildad)
A great, ungodly, god-like
man, I'd say.
BILDAD
Aye, but above the common.
PELEG
(to Ishmael)
He doesn't speak much...but
when he does, you'd do well
to listen.
A huge shadow crosses over them. Peleg and Bildad
fall silent as they look up.
Queequeg towers over them, standing behind Ishmael
with his harpoon. He nods at Ishmael, encouraging
him to introduce him. Ishmael understands.
ISHMAEL
This is my friend Queequeg.
He wants to ship, too.
Both the captains look Queequeg over with some dismay.
Everyone on board turns to regard this tattooed giant.
PELEG
"Quohog"? Doesn't look like
much of a Christian to me.
21.
ISHMAEL
Why, he's killed more whales
than you can count...
Queequeg rests a hand on his shoulder to stop him. He
coolly faces the captains and points at a small, dark
knothole on the farthest mast.
QUEEQUEG
Cap'n, ee see him small dark
spot on mastwood there? Ee
see him? Well, s'pose him
one whale eye! Well, den...
He raises the harpoon and effortlessly darts it...
An Olympic throw across the deck -- past Bildad's
nose, over the Cook's head -- a bull's eye into the
mast target! The big iron quivers mightily.
Queequeg playfully hauls at the harpoon line and
gives the two shocked captains a broad grin.
QUEEQUEG (cont'd)
Dat whale dead!
A silent beat. Bildad turns excitedly to his partner.
BILDAD
Quick, Peleg, quick, get the
ship's papers! We must have
Quohog here, I mean Hedgehog,
whatever his name is!
Peleg scrambles for a ledger, opens it up. He extends
a pen to Queequeg, anxious for him to sign.
PELEG
Look here...we'll give you
one-ninetieth percent, that's
a higher cut of the ship's
whale-oil cargo than we've
ever given any harpooner!
So what say ye?
QUEEQUEG
What be about me friend?
PELEG
22.
Oh, all right then...we'll
sign him on too.
(to Ishmael)
But you earn only a fifth of
what HE gets!
Ishmael and Queequeg exchange pleased grins.
EXT. NANTUCKET DOCK -DAY
Ishmael and Queequeg stride back down the dock, their
belongings left behind. Both in high spirits.
VOICE
Hist! Shipmates!
Distracted by a craggy voice behind them, the two slow
their pace and glance around.
Elijah, the demented old man from last night, beckons
them from inside the open doorway of a blacksmith shed.
ELIJAH (cont'd)
Shipmates! Come hither!
Ishmael and Queequeg stop and regard him curiously.
He beckons them frantically. They venture closer.
INT. BLACKSMITH SHED - DAY
A shadowy, deserted place. Blacksmith tools hang
like ancient weapons. Half in the sunlight of the
doorway, Ishmael and Queequeg face Elijah, who
remains in shadow.
ISHMAEL
What d'ye want, old man?
The ragged old codger looks them both over like a man possessed.
In a harsh, broken breath:
ELIJAH
Have ye shipped in that
ship then, have ye?!
Ishmael trades looks with Queequeg, who regards Elijah
more with apprehension than curiosity.
ISHMAEL
23.
The Pequod? Why yes, we've
just signed the articles.
ELIJAH
The articles, eh? Anything in
there about your SOULS?!
Fire in his eyes, as if this were a revelation.
ELIJAH (cont'd)
No? Perhaps you haven't got
any!? No matter! I know
plenty of men haven't got a
soul -- good luck to 'em!
Better off for it, some of
'em! A soul's sort of a
fifth wheel to a wagon,
don't ye think?
ISHMAEL
What're ye jabberin' about?
Elijah gestures outside with great flourish.
ELIJAH
Oh, but HE's got enough to
make up for the rest of us...
plenty more than enough!
ISHMAEL
Let's go, Queequeg. This
fellow's broken loose from
his moorings...
ELIJAH
I'm tellin' ye about OLD
THUNDER! Haven't seen Old
Thunder yet, have you?
ISHMAEL
Who's Old Thunder?
ELIJAH
Captain Ahab! Ye haven't
seen him yet, have ye?
Queequeg shakes his head slowly. Ishmael looks away, exasperated.
Elijah cackles maniacally.
24.
ELIJAH
No, I didn't think so! Did
they tell ye about him?
ISHMAEL
I know all I need to know.
ELIJAH
All about it, eh? You sure
now? But is all ye need to
know ever enough, I ask you!?
Ishmael starts to leave, but Queequeg detains him.
ELIJAH (cont'd)
So you've shipped then, have
ye? Names down on paper?
Well, what's to be will be...
then again perhaps it won't!
Anyhow, it's all fixed, all
been arranged! Has been for
a long time!
ISHMAEL
What? What's been fixed?
What're ye blatherin' about?
ELIJAH
The prophecy, mate! The
prophecy of the PEQUOD! All
aboard her will perish, save
one man! All but one!
Ishmael frowns at the old lunatic, fed up with this
nonsense. Queequeg stares, frozen in place.
ELIJAH (cont'd)
Didn't know THAT, did ye,
mates?! Did ye?! Did ye?!
ISHMAEL
Come along, Queequeg. Let's
leave this fool to his ravings.
Queequeg can't take his eyes off Elijah, a hint of
fear in his eyes. Ishmael tugs at Queequeg, and they
leave Elijah cackling at them from the shed doorway.
25.
ELIJAH
All but one! All but one!
EXT. NANTUCKET DOCK - DAY
They exit the blacksmith shed and move on toward town.
Ishmael looks a bit disturbed but tries not to show it.
Queequeg is deeply perturbed. Ishmael notices this
and jostles him.
ISHMAEL
Don't take it to heart, he's
just some crazy old loon...
QUEEQUEG
Ishmael? What be a soul?
ISHMAEL
A soul? Well, that's a
difficult question...
He hears a CHURCH BELL RINGING in the distance.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Ye believe in God, Queequeg?
Y'know...like a big chief
over all men?
QUEEQUEG
Like Yojo.
ISHMAEL
I reckon so, but bigger than
that. Like a captain of the
stars.
He notices TOWNSPEOPLE moving toward a white clapboard
church with a tall steeple. Thinking to himself.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
I can't really explain it to
ye...but I can SHOW ye.
EXT. NANTUCKET CHURCH -DAY
Ishmael and Queequeg approach the church. Queequeg
stops before it, hesitating. He's never been inside
one before, and it unnerves him a little.
26.
ISHMAEL
It's just a house of God,
Queequeg...OUR god, that is.
(urges him on)
Trust me. Ye can learn all
about the soul here.
Queequeg nods, trusting him implicitly. They move on.
INT. CHURCH -DAY
A CONGREGATION is gathered in pews, facing a pulpit
unlike any other -- built to exactly replicate the
bow of a ship. Its towering platform forms the mock
ship's sharp prow.
Ishmael and Queequeg enter quietly and take a rear
seat, Queequeg drawing stares.
Among the worshippers sits STARBUCK (30's), a sharp,
good-looking, experienced seaman with a pragmatic way
about him, full of watchful curiosity. Beside him,
his seasoned WIFE and TWO beautiful CHILDREN. Nearby
sit Bulkington and his Fiancee, their hands clenched
tight. Starbuck's Wife glances toward Bulkington's
bride: the girl looks tense and anxious.
Up front sits Ahab's weary Wife, red-eyed from long
nights of tears. And her son, a fixed, distant gaze.
From the high pulpit looms FATHER MAPPLE, a patronly,
messiah-like figure.
In the rear pews, Ishmael recognizes the minister and
nudges Queequeg, whispering aside.
ISHMAEL
That's Father Mapple. I hear
he used to be a harpooner.
Father Mapple scans the scattered gathering before him
with a furrowed brow and waves them all closer. With
a deep, penetrating voice:
MAPPLE
Come closer, shipmates! You
there, side away to larboard!
And you, gangway to starboard!
27.
Midship! Midship!
A rustle of feet, as everyone quickly rises and takes
new seats closer to the pulpit. Father Mapple waits
as they settle down. He lifts his closed eyes, as if
praying from the bottom of the sea. Then looks down,
every word like God's commandment:
MAPPLE (cont'd)
The Book of Jonah! First
chapter, last verse -- look
down and read it, mates!
"And God had prepared a great
fish to swallow up Jonah!"
Below him, the SOUND of pages turning, MUTED MUMBLINGS.
MAPPLE (cont'd)
The Lord called upon Jonah
to cry out against wickedness,
but instead Jonah fled from
God's command! WHY? Why did
he willfully disobey God?
Because he thought it was
too HARD!
The congregation stops turning pages, everyone mesmerized
by the resonance of his voice.
MAPPLE (cont'd)
TOO HARD! Why, everything God
commands us to do is hard!
That is why He commands more
often than He tries to persuade!
He knows that if we obey Him,
we DISOBEY OURSELVES! That is
hard! It is hard because we
cannot flee from his command,
as Jonah tried to do...hard
because God is everywhere and
there is no hope of escaping
Him!
(dramatic pause)
Now, imagine poor Jonah...
prowling among ships like a
burglar, rushing to cross the
seas and escape from his God!
But how could he do so? By
thinking that a ship made by
28.
men will carry him to places
where God does not reign?!
Ahab's Wife listens, as if these words were directed
at her. Tears stream down her face.
MAPPLE (cont'd)
And now the time of tide has
come. The ship casts off her
lines and sets away on the
great, wide ocean. But the
sea rebels! Oh, and the wind!
Every sail tears, every plank
thunders with trampling feet!
(beat)
But Jonah does not see the
black sky nor the raging sea
all around him! He does not
see it -- he does not CARE!
Ishmael and Queequeg listen, entranced. So too does
Starbuck and his family.
MAPPLE (cont'd)
The God-fugitive is plainly
known to all on board, and
so they blame HIM for the
tempest upon them! So they
lift up Jonah like an anchor
and drop him into the sea!
MAPPLE (cont'd)
(booming stormily)
And God comes upon him in a
MIGHTY WHALE! Clamps all his
ivory teeth about him! Then
swallows him whole into the
belly of hell -- and dives
ten thousand fathoms down to
living GULFS OF DOOM!
The men wince, the wives cringe in vicarious horror.
The children hide their faces in their parent's arms.
Having made his effect, Father Mapple softens his voice:
MAPPLE (cont'd)
To the watery world of woe.
There among the ocean bottom's
29.
bones did Jonah cry out his
repentance. And God in that
whale breached and vomited
out Jonah upon the land. And
ever after, Jonah preached the
truth in the face of falsehood,
against the proud commodores
of this earth, and stood forth
his inexorable self!
He turns to every face in the congregation, appealing to
each one, beseeching them.
MAPPLE (cont'd)
Shipmates, my brethren of the
sea...hear me. Delight to him
who gives no quarter in the
truth. But woe to him who would
NOT be true, even though to be
false would be his salvation!
Over this, we feature the faces of Starbuck, listening
with grave understanding...Ahab's wife, eyes clenched
in grief...and finally Ishmael and Queequeg. The
Christian and the pagan, trying to fathom the words.
MAPPLE (cont'd)
Brothers, let us pray...
(his eyes closed)
Dear heavenly father, may we
strive to be thine, more than
to be this world's or our own.
For what is a man that he should
not live out the lifetime of
his God?
A long silence over the congregation.
FADE OUT.
ACT 3
EXT. NANTUCKET BAY - DAY
The distant Pequod sets sail out of the harbor beneath a
dramatic sky. She passes the headlands, bound for sea.
EXT. NANTUCKET HEADLANDS - DAY
30.
The tiny figures of women hasten to the top of the great
black cliffs.
EXT. CLIFF PROMONTORY - DAY
NANTUCKET WIVES in their bleak dresses and shawls run in
scattered groups to a high vantage point. They collect together
on the promontory, all eyes cast seaward to
catch a last glimpse of their husbands' dwindling ship.
Among them is Starbuck's Wife, a face of sad remorse.
Stubb's two Doxies, gushing tears. Ahab's grieving Wife,
who has no more tears left to cry. All bear the look of
women who have become widows in their men's lifetimes.
Standing alone, Bulkington's Fiancee gazes forlornly
out, hugging herself with anxious dread. Starbuck's
Wife approaches and lays a comforting arm around her.
From their view, the Pequod shrinks into the horizon.
EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
The magnificent Pequod drives to windward, her great
sails full to bursting. She plunges through the big
swells of choppy Atlantic waters.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) -MIDDECK/QUARTERDECK - DAY
A pitching deck, alive with activity. Sailors scurry
about, climbing ladders, reefing sails, trimming yards
under the calm commands of First Mate Starbuck.
STARBUCK
Back the main yard there!
Up helm! Hearts alive now!
Struggling on a taut halyard from middeck, Ishmael pulls
with difficulty. Queequeg pulls with powerful ease.
Third Mate Flask, pulling rank to make up for his low
stature and ignorance, shouts at those on the rope.
FLASK
Pull, ye monkeys, or by gor
I'll give ye a good sea toss!
31.
He turns on Ishmael who stops, his soft hands blistering.
FLASK (cont'd)
Go to it, landlubber, pull!
Flukes and flames, boy, are
ye that green in the gills?!
ISHMAEL
Not that green, sir!
He keeps pulling, despite the pain. Queequeg gives Flask
a surly look.
FLASK
What're YOU lookin' at, ye
dumb, painted savage?!
Second Mate Stubb leans over the quarterdeck bannister, smoking
a proverbial short black pipe.
STUBB
Lookin' at a dumber one, I'd
say!
He laughs and turns, calling to a lookout high aloft.
STUBB (cont'd)
Ho! Masthead there! Look
sharp! We'll be sightin' for
whales from sunup to sundown!
If ye see one, split yer
lungs, d'ye hear?!
EXT. MASTS - DAY
High on the topgallant mast stands harpooner TASHTEGO,
an American Indian with long hair and the noble face of
a warrior hunter. A muscled giant like Queequeg.
Climbing a swaying rope ladder in the breeze is another
harpooner DAGOO, a coal-black barbarian with huge gold
loops in his ears. Another giant.
A strong gust of wind hits the sails. The men react
immediately, scrambling over spars like nimble spiders.
STARBUCK (O.S.)
32.
Hands by the halyards! In
top-gallant sails! Stand by
to reef topsails!
STUBB (O.S.)
Jump, my jollies!
Dagoo and others tumble toward the topmasts, among
them Bulkington. The two men taunt each other good-
naturedly as they go about their dangerous business,
shouting between masts:
BULKINGTON
The squall! Jump the squall!
Lend me yer earring, Dagoo,
so I can secure this sail!
DAGOO
Come and get it, white skin!
Both laugh, as they climb right over the canvas of the
billowing sails.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
The halyard pulling stops. Ishmael nurses his palms and staggers
across the heaving deck, a bit seasick.
A ship's boom swings across the deck, about to broadside
him -- Queequeg yanks him out of the way. Both topple
across the deck together. Stubb bellows a laugh.
STUBB
One hand for the ship, Mister
Ishmael, one hand for yerself!
Ishmael rises to his feet, nods his thanks to Queequeg, humiliated
but keeping his pride. To Stubb:
ISHMAEL
Aye, aye, sir. But I don't
think it's proper to make
jest of another man's peril.
STUBB
Aye, but you're wrong! It's
laughter that's the final
consequence of everything!
The only comfort a man has,
33.
and the wisest one!
ISHMAEL
The easiest, you mean.
Stubb leaps down from the quarterdeck and claps him on
the shoulder with a hard but friendly whack.
STUBB
The ONLY comfort, shipmate,
and the wisest, I tell you!
Wise Stubb, that's what they
call me -- and that's because,
whatever happens, I go to it
laughing!
Another bellowing laugh. Ishmael nods, accepting that.
Flask joins them, hard-eying Ishmael as he faces Stubb.
FLASK
Just don't ever let fightin'
FLASK catch ye laughin' at
'im, Stubb!
(nods at Ishmael)
So what're we goin' to do
with this pup?
(to Ishmael)
Yer own mother would make a
better sailor.
ISHMAEL
I'm tryin' my best, sir.
Flask picks up a bucket and tosses it roughly to him.
FLASK
Then try this! Swab the deck,
since that's all yer good for.
Ishmael resigns himself to it. Pip dances by, banging
cheerily on his tambourine, lifting Ishmael's spirits.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
By the deckhouse, Starbuck watches all that goes on
around him. He glances toward the closed door of the Captain's
cabin. No Ahab in sight. He calls out:
34.
STARBUCK
Mister Bulkington! Give us
a good song to speed us on!
Alighting down on deck, Bulkington turns with reserved
manner. Then BELTS OUT a song with unexpected relish:
BULKINGTON
In the Indian Ocean, Pacific
Ocean, no matter what ocean:
pull ahead, yo heave O! Soon
ye'll hear the cry "Town O!"
The whole crew joins in, as they work from deck to masts.
CREWMEN
"There she blows, hard up,
square the yards then, steady,
lads, so!" cries the Captain.
Soon as we get near boys, in
with the gear, boys, swing the
crane clear, boys, pull ahead
now, yo heave O!
Swabbing the deck on his knees, Ishmael winces from his
bruised hands but manages a smile and sings awkwardly
along. Queequeg kneels down and joins him at washing
the deck. Singing too.
Nearby, the arthritic Carpenter drills a short hole in
the planking. Ishmael watches him, noticing other holes
all around the deck in random places.
ISHMAEL
What're those holes for, sir?
CARPENTER
Captain's orders -- mind yer
own business!
Taken back by that, Ishmael keeps swabbing. He gazes up toward
the Captain's cabin door with ambivalent curiosity.
Toiling beside him, Queequeg follows Ishmael's eyes.
QUEEQUEG
Ship wid no cap'n. Yojo no
sabbee dis.
Stubb passes by. Ishmael rises to rest his hands.
35.
ISHMAEL
Mister Stubb, sir? Will he
ever make an appearance, do
ye suppose? Ahab, I mean?
STUBB
Your guess is as good as mine.
ISHMAEL
Will we see a whale soon, I
wonder?
STUBB
We will and ye'll soon not
forget it! Ye haven't lived,
young monkey, 'til you've
raised a whale!
He moves on. Ishmael stares out over the rolling sea.
INT. FORECASTLE -NIGHT
Cramped, claustrophobic crews' quarters. Walls of bunks
around dining tables, all too small for some thirty men.
A rowdy, sweaty atmosphere, oil lamps swinging.
Motley crewmen queue before a steaming turrine at a
Parsons table, as the Cook ladles chowder into their bowls.
Two of them, PERTH and DOUGH-BOY, examine their bowls of
watery stew with disgust.
PERTH
Blast! Chowder for breakfast,
chowder for supper...
DOUGH-BOY
This swill ain't fit for a dog!
COOK
Mind yer tongue, swabby, or
I'll cut it off and add it to
the pot!
He brandishes a formidable kitchen knife. Then fills a
bowl for the Carpenter, who nods slyly at a big beetle skittering
across the turrine table.
CARPENTER
36.
Add that, Cook -- mebbe it'll
improve the flavor.
The others laugh. Sneering sourly at him, the Cook
jabs down his knife to kill the insect. He misses.
The Carpenter whips out a hammer and swings down --
WHACK! Bull's eye. He grins at the pouting Cook.
The men take their bowls to a dining table. The
Carpenter plops down beside the BLACKSMITH, a begrimed
old salt with burn scars all over his flesh. Perth
and Dough-Boy sit next to them.
PERTH
Say, carpenter, where d'ye
keep your rum these days? I'm
itchin' for a taste.
CARPENTER
What rum? It's against ship's
orders, ye know that.
Nearby, Ishmael straddles a bench with Queequeg, who
swaths Ishmael's raw, bleeding hands with cloth strips.
PERTH
Lookit them two lovebirds...
(to Ishmael)
Careful with your hand, mate,
your slave there might be
mistakin' it for supper!
Queequeg turns with noble dignity.
QUEEQUEG
Queequeg no slave. Queequeg
son to island king.
The other two laugh at that. Perth bows mockingly.
PERTH
Oh, a thousands pardons, your
Majesty!
DOUGH-BOY
Hail to the prince of savages!
Two brawny hulks sit opposite them: red Tashtego and
black Dagoo, giving them looks to kill. Perth and
37.
Dough-Boy turn to their stew, suddenly quiet.
Ishmael looks at Queequeg as he finishes bandaging.
ISHMAEL
You pagans need to teach us
Christians the art of kindness.
QUEEQUEG
No matter. Queequeg-ee be
friends, aye? Queequeg hungry!
ISHMAEL
Aye! Grub ho!
They rise and wend their way to the Cook's turrine.
Stubb and Flask enter. The men's rabble rousing settles
down to a respectful lull.
STUBB
At ease, ye sons of bachelors!
We ain't the Capt'n, after all.
TASHTEGO
What capt'n? He don't exist.
Stubb and Flask observes Ishmael with his swathed hands, holding
his bowl with great difficulty as the Cook
ladles out stew.
STUBB
You're in a sad pickle, lad.
FLASK
What say we open some grog
to quell his growin' pains?
STUBB
Not without permission from
the Capt'n.
FLASK
To hell with permission...
He makes for the Carpenter's bunk and kicks open a tool
box -- revealing a hidden rum bottle. Flask snatches it
up. The Carpenter jumps up, alarmed.
CARPENTER
38.
See here! That's my medicine!
FLASK
Potent medicine, I'll wager...
He pops out the cork with his teeth and starts to take
a swig -- Stubb grabs it away from him.
STUBB
No medicine for you, Flask!
Let's christen our new pup...
(to Ishmael)
Come here, me boy! This'll
cure ye...
Ishmael turns, gingerly holding his bowl. Stubb pours
rum over his bandaged hands. Ishmael drops the bowl --
screams in pain! Stubb pushes the bottle at him.
STUBB (cont'd)
Quick! Drink, lad, it'll
kill the pain...
Agonizing, Ishmael grabs the bottle with hot hands
and takes a quick, deep swig. He spits out a mouthful
and gasps, his insides burning worse than his hands.
STUBB (cont'd)
Go on -- take another! Ye
may be dry for a long spell
to come!
Looking around at the mates GOADING him on, Ishmael
takes the challenge. He chugalugs from the bottle.
FLASK
Aye! That's the manly way!
Aloof on his bunk in b.g., Bulkington watches them.
STUBB
Well done, sailor!
Ishmael can't speak, his breath on fire, sinking faintly
on a bench. Queequeg pounds his back to revive him.
The others eye the bottle, anxious for a taste. Their
grubby hands grope for it, but Flask pushes them back.
39.
FLASK
Easy, this ain't for you...
(to Ishmael)
Go to it, pup! Drink to yer
first whale kill!
Woozy Ishmael downs another healthy swallow, getting
used to the burn. Getting drunk.
The men laugh and urge him on, their MERRIMENT rising
in pitch, until...
In b.g. comes a familiar THUNK-CLOP, THUNK-CLOP...
STUBB
Hist! Cut your seizings!
The crew falls silent, eyes on the swaying ceiling.
The RHYTHMIC THUNK-CLOP of a pacing peg leg on deck.
Then it stops. A long, quiet beat between the men.
Stubb turns to Ishmael, in a low voice:
STUBB (cont'd)
He lost that leg to a whale,
is what I heard. Devoured,
it was! Chewed up by the
most monstrous fish that
ever chipped a boat!
FLASK
Aye...a terrifyin' creature,
they say, and fearful angry!
STUBB
Well, no whale's ever happy
to be hunted. I wouldn't want
any man in my boat who ain't
afraid of 'em.
FLASK
An' I don't want any who are!
(to Ishmael)
Why, I've lowered for a sperm
whale from a leaking ship in
a gale off Cape Horn!
Weaving drunkenly, Ishmael listens fascinated.
ISHMAEL
40.
What about Captain Ahab?
STUBB
Ahab? He's hunted more whales
than all of us put together.
FLASK
Killed fifteen of 'em between
a sunrise and a sunset!
ISHMAEL
What of the whale that took
his leg? Did he kill it too?
STUBB
Bulkington would know. He
was there.
All faces turn to Bulkington, far removed in his bunk.
FLASK
Tell us, mate! Tell us what
happened to the Capt'n?
STUBB
Aye, spin us a yarn!
Everyone waits with anticipation. Bulkington just
stares at the ceiling, then replies with finality:
BULKINGTON
I don't wish to speak of it.
He says no more, the others groaning disappointedly.
Ishmael keeps drinking, plowed under. Stubb turns to
him, feeding his imagination.
STUBB
I'll tell ye this much, pup.
A good-sized sperm whale can
ram, shiver and sink a ship
in a matter of seconds!
FLASK
Aye -- even a Man o' War!
TASHTEGO
An' dey thirst for human
41.
blood!
STUBB
Why, sharks are so a-feared
of 'em, they dash themselves
into rocks just to flee a
whale's wake!
Drunken Ishmael listens with wide-eyed terror. Pip
dances around the quarters, breaking the tension.
PIP
Crish, crash! Blang-whang!
I've heard all that chat now!
Makes me jingle all over!
THUNK-CLOP, more pacing above deck. Pip stops. A
dead pause among the crew, all eyes turned upward.
The PEG LEG paces ceaselessly. Back and forth,
back and forth.
FADE OUT.
ACT 4
EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - MORNING
A bright, cloudless day. The Pequod sails along on
a calm sea.
INT. FORECASTLE - MORNING
In his bunk, groggy-eyed Ishmael awakens. A splitting
hangover. He sits up painfully with his bandaged hands
and focuses on the bustle of men around him:
Deckhands wash and dress, preparing for the morning
watch. Queequeg shaves before a shard of mirror with
the razor edge of his harpoon.
A sailor has his head down on a bench, the Carpenter
about to pierce his ear with a nail and hammer.
Ishmael rises and shuffles to a wash bin, holding his
aching head. He winces to the RAP of a hammer -- and
a sailor's SCREAM.
42.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) -MIDDECK - MORNING
Starbuck and Stubb are on watch, gauging the wind and
the luff of the sails. Starbuck shouts up:
STARBUCK
Helm there! Luff a point!
The SHIP'S STEWARD rings a bell for the morning watch.
Stubb booms down into the forecastle:
STUBB
First watch! All hands on
deck! Come along, ye solemn
rogues, cease your preening!
The rest of the crew spill onto the deck, hastening
to their duties. Stubb grins at a hung-over Ishmael,
shouting close:
STUBB (cont'd)
You're on morning lookout,
sailor! Get aloft!
Ishmael grimaces. Nursing sore hands, he looks up apprehensively
at the towering masthead.
Queequeg steps between them.
QUEEQUEG
Beg-ee pardon, sir! Queequeg
go aloft!
STUBB
Nay, every man takes his turn.
He whacks Ishmael's aching back, a quick laugh.
STUBB (cont'd)
This mother's boy has got to
earn his salt! Hop to it!
ISHMAEL
Aye, aye, sir...
Steeling himself, Ishmael takes the first rungs of the
43.
rope ladder with swathed hands and painfully hoists
himself up. He climbs up slowly, unaccustomed to the
wide rungs.
STUBB
Jump to it! Legs, man, legs!
EXT. MAST - MORNING
Ishmael climbs faster with all his strength, the ladder
swaying in the wind. The higher he climbs, the more
the ships seems to pitch and toss. He looks down:
A dizzying view of a tiny deck, blue sea all around.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
Queequeg waves to urge him on. By now, most of the
crew are watching Ishmael's virgin climb. Starbuck
sidles over beside Stubb with amusement and concern.
STARBUCK
You are a cruel taskmaster,
Mister Stubb.
STUBB
Aye, but we'll make a seamen
of him yet.
EXT. TOPMAST - MORNING
High aloft, Ishmael braves it to the topgallant mast.
The lookout top under his feet are two thin sticks,
a hundred feet above deck. Like standing on weaving
stilts. Ishmael perches himself, holding on for
dear life. He's made it.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
The crew CHEERS. Grinning Stubb shouts up:
STUBB
Keep your weather eye open
and look sharp!
EXT. TOPMAST - MORNING
44.
Towering over vast ocean, Ishmael forgets his pain and
scans the magnificent vista. An exhilarating experience.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
Men busy at work. Flask tosses Pip his tambourine.
FLASK
Give us some cheer, Pip!
Bang it, rig it, make fire
flies and rattle our teeth!
Pip plays it and dances a fast jig, skipping merrily
around the middeck, toward the quarter deck...then
suddenly stops. His eyes fix on an unsettling sight.
Starbuck, Stubb, Flask, all deckhands cease their
duties and fall silent. Staring in Pip's direction:
EXT. QUARTERDECK - MORNING
Captain Ahab looms high before the deckhouse. A godlike
figure in bronze, braced against the wind. With his peg
leg and white scar on his face, he's a frightening sight.
Flanked behind him are the five Arabs we glimpsed at the
outset, dressed in strange attire. FEDALLAH, the turbaned
one, sports a sinister, dark-eyed face with an ugly smile
of broken teeth. Ahab's personal harpooner, his shadow.
Ahab glares down at the men scattered around the middeck,
searching their faces.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
Everyone faces him, silent and still. The three ship's
mates draw close together, their voices low:
STUBB
Who are them funny-lookin'
boys with the Capt'n?
STARBUCK
Stowaways, it looks like.
45.
FLANK
I don't like the look of 'em.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - MORNING
Scanning faces, Ahab finally spots Starbuck. He hobbles
vigorously forward with a fixed glare.
AHAB
Mister Starbuck!
STARBUCK
Sir!
AHAB
Send everybody aft, Mister
Starbuck! Everybody, y'hear?!
STARBUCK
Yessir! All hands aft!
Ahab THUNK-CLOPS along the bannister, glancing aloft.
AHAB
Mastheads up there! Come
down!
EXT. MASTS - MORNING
The men on the yards descend quickly, sliding down
sails and halyard ropes.
High on his perch, Ishmael climbs down urgently,
no longer afraid, anxious to get below.
EXT. AFT DECK - MORNING
Ahab climbs down and paces the deck with a familiar
PEG-LEG SOUND. A restless, dark-spirited figure.
Starbuck comes before him, followed by the crew.
STARBUCK
All men assembled, Captain!
Ahab keeps pacing, deep in thought.
Looking on, Stubb whispers aside to Flask.
46.
STUBB
Look at him, Flask, there's
something like a chick in
him, peckin' at his shell,
fightin' to get out!
FLASK
Maybe he's got us all here
to show us how well he
walks on one leg.
The last to arrive, Ishmael cranes his neck behind the
others to get a better view of the Captain.
Ahab stops pacing and plants a whalebone peg into one
of the Carpenter's deck holes, rooting himself. He
faces the crew. A deep, throaty resonance, loud and
forceful:
AHAB
What do ye do when ye see a
WHALE, men?!
The men look momentarily puzzled. Then, a tentative
chorus:
CREWMEN
Sing out...sing out for him!
A beat, then Ahab's glare dissolves away to a slow but infectious
smile. He nods approvingly.
AHAB
Good! And what next?
FLASK
Lower away, and after him!
AHAB
And what tune do ye pull to
in your whaleboats? As ye
go after him?
STUBB
A dead whale or a sunk boat!
Ahab slams his fists down onto the bulwark -- BARKS
with guttural satisfaction. He reaches into his vest
47.
pocket, withdraws his hand and holds something up in
the air for all to see: a large Spanish gold coin.
The men edge curiously closer. Ahab brandishes it
high before them.
AHAB
Look, men...d'ye see this?!
'Tis an ounce of Spanish
gold! A sixteen-dollar
piece!
An enthusiastic murmur among the crew. Pip rattles
his tambourine. The murmur quickly dies down, as Ahab
makes his way down to middeck. The sharp THUNK-CLOP
of his peg leg rings out like a bell.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
Ahab struts the full length of the ship, moving from
peghole to peghole to anchor himself whenever he stops,
the long deck his actor's stage. The volcanic fire
inside him burns the air all about him.
AHAB (cont'd)
Look closer, mates! D'ye
see it?
All eyes shift back and forth between the gold piece
and Ahab's fiery eyes. Starbuck glances toward
Fedallah, immobile in b.g. Puzzled by it all.
Ahab reaches the awestruck Carpenter with his toolbox.
AHAB (cont'd)
Carpenter, hand me yon hammer!
And one strong iron nail!
The Carpenter produces the hammer from his belt and
digs quickly into his box. Ahab turns to scan the
gruff faces all around him.
Men avoid his eyes, looking only at the coin.
The Carpenter offers the hammer and a nail. Ahab
snatches them and half-strides back across the deck
to the main mast. His voice begins with a low,
48.
intense growl, building to a roar:
AHAB (cont'd)
Whosoever of ye raises me a
white-headed whale...aye,
white-headed with a wrinkled
brow and a crooked jaw...
whosoever raises me that
snow-white whale with holes
punctured in his starboard
fluke, I say...whosoever
among ye raises me that
ACCURSED WHITE WHALE...HE
shall have this gold ounce!
More murmurs from the crew, louder and more excited.
Stubb and Flask exchange hushed, animated words.
Starbuck watches in amazed silence.
Detached from the crowd, only Bulkington shows no
reaction. He stares seaward with a grim face.
The three big harpooners exchange challenging grins.
Tashtego steps forward.
TASHTEGO
Must be dat whale folks call
Moby Dick, eh, Capt'n?
On Ahab's face, a remarkable transformation. He turns
toward Tashtego, his low voice like an animal snarl:
AHAB
Moby Dick! Do ye know the
white whale then, Tashtego?
Dagoo speaks out before Tashtego can answer, Ahab's
head shifting to him with reptilian speed.
DAGOO
Aye! That whale has an odd
spout, too...mighty large
and...bushy with white wool.
That the one, Capt'n?
QUEEQUEG
Queequeg sabee him! Him got
many iron spears in him hide,
Cap'n! All twisketee...like...
49.
AHAB
Like twisted metal! Aye, like
corkscrews!
His brow clears, his voice a roar of barely contained
emotion:
AHAB
Aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie
all twisted in him like so many
corkscrews! Aye, Dagoo...his
spout is a big one, like a whole
shock of wheat, as thick as a
pile of Nantucket wool! Aye,
Tash...by death and devils,
that white whale is MOBY DICK!
'Tis MOBY DICK ye have seen...
MOBY DICK!
The name seems to strangle him. A spontaneous SHOUT
erupts from the men around him, sharing his rage.
Ishmael watches, engrossed in the high drama of this
moment. Finally, Starbuck steps soberly forward.
STARBUCK
I have heard of Moby Dick,
Captain. Was it not Moby
Dick that took off your leg?
Ahab spins around to face Starbuck, his face aflame.
AHAB
Who told ye that?
STARBUCK
It's common knowledge, sir.
AHAB
Aye, Mister Starbuck...aye!
(to his crew)
Aye, my hearties all round...
'twas Moby Dick that dismasted
me! Moby Dick that reaped away
my limb like a mower a blade of
grass! Moby Dick that brought
me to this...DEAD STUMP I stand
on now! Aye! 'Twas that
damnedable beast that razed me!
Made a poor pegging lubber of
me...forever and a day!
50.
He lifts his hands, clenched around both coin and hammer.
AHAB (cont'd)
MOBY DICK! And I'll chase
that white whale round Good
Hope, round the Horn -- and
round PERDITION'S FLAMES
before I give him up!
Starbuck reacts, bewildered by Ahab's outburst. He
watches disturbed, as the men SHOUT "Ayes!" of support.
Ahab steps from man to man, right up to each face.
AHAB (cont'd)
This is what ye have shipped
for, men! To chase that white
whale on both sides of land
and over all the oceans --
'til he spouts black blood
and rolls dead out!
He turns to the main mast. Slams the gold coin high on
the mast wood, places a nail to it and hammers the coin
fast to the mast. Then turns back, calling the Steward.
AHAB
Steward! Go draw a great
measure of grog!
(to his crew)
What say ye, men? Will ye
splice hands on it? Now?!
I think ye do look brave!
The harpooners are first to react.
TASHTEGO
Aye, aye!
DAGOO
A sharp eye for the white
whale!
QUEEQUEG
Sharp spear for Moby Dick!
The rest now join in a CHORUS of "Aye, ayes!" Ahab
nods, deeply moved by their reaction.
AHAB
God bless ye, men!
51.
The Steward rolls out a grog barrel to the CHEERING
crew. Cups are filled to the brim. Ahab turns to
notice the concern on Starbuck's face.
AHAB (cont'd)
What ails ye, Mister Starbuck?
Why the long face?
Starbuck is hesitant to respond.
AHAB (cont'd)
Will ye not chase the white
whale, then? Not game for
Moby Dick, are ye?
STARBUCK
Oh, I am. I'm game for the
jaws of death, if it's part of
the business we're here for.
I came to hunt whales, not my
commander's vengeance. How
many barrels of oil will your
vengeance yield, I ask ye?
Ahab studies Starbuck with a colder, narrower eye.
AHAB
I see. Is money to be the
measure of everything we do,
then? Then let me tell ye:
my vengeance will fetch a
great premium -- HERE!
He slams his fist against his own chest. An electric
beat between them, Starbuck shaken by him.
STARBUCK
What d'ye wish of me, Captain?
AHAB
Help me strike a fin! Not an
impossible, nor wondrous feat
for you -- the best lance out of
all Nantucket! Surely YOU, of
all the crew, would not be the
one to hang back! Speak, man!
Starbuck wearily meets his fiery eyes, sapped by his
52.
energy. He says nothing. Ahab's brow darkens.
AHAB (cont'd)
Your silence speaks loudly, sir.
(turns away)
The measure, men! The measure!
He abandons Starbuck, leading the party with animated
bravado, passing around cups. Starbuck shakes his head.
STARBUCK
May God help us all.
AHAB
Drink and pass! Round with
it, round! Short draughts,
long swallows, my braves...
(drinks deep)
Ahh, t'is hot as Satan's hoof!
Well done, almost drained!
Hand me another, boy, here's
a hollow! So brimming life
is gulped and gone, men!
Steward! Refill!
He downs a cupful in one long draught. Despite his
peg leg, he suddenly leaps agilely onto one of the
whaling boats.
The crew watches, amazed by his charismatic energy, intimidated
by him. All but Starbuck.
AHAB (cont'd)
Attend now, mates, flank me!
Harpooners, stand here with
your irons! And ye mariners,
all of you, ring me in...let
me revive a noble custom of my
fishermen fathers before me!
Stubb, Starbuck and Flask grab their lances. Queequeg, Tashtego
and Dagoo appear, carrying two harpoons each.
Ahab waves them closer around the whaling boat.
Ishmael bears silent witness: something mystical in
the aspect of bald, scarred Ahab towering above the
rest in the boat, his black coat flapping about him.
53.
AHAB (cont'd)
Advance, mates! Cross your
lances full in front of me!
Now let me touch the axis!
Ahab leans down and grasps the three lances at their
crossed center, peering intently into each man's eyes.
Stubb and Flask can't sustain his inflamed glare and turn their
eyes away from his. Starbuck gazes evenly at him.
AHAB (cont'd)
Did ye three feel the full
force SHOCK of it?! Mine own
electric thing?! Now mates,
be my appointed cup-bearers to
your three pagan kinsmen there...
He abruptly pushes away their lances, breaking the spell.
Then he turns his laser-like focus on the harpooners,
standing behind the mates.
AHAB (cont'd)
Draw the poles, harpooners!
The three giant harpooners quickly remove the iron part
of their harpoons like proud knights before their king.
They step up to Ahab with ritualistic fervor and -- with perfect
timing -- thrust the irons toward him.
Ahab reaches down from the whaleboat -- slams his open
palm onto a sharp blade. Blood gushes from his hand.
Unflinchingly, Ahab rises with bold majesty.
AHAB (cont'd)
Now cant them! Turn them
over, I say! Show me the
goblet end! Turn up the
socket! So...so! Now hold
them while I fill! Steward,
bring me your flask!
The Steward hands him a flask. Ahab fills the harpoon
sockets with grog, full to the brim...dripping drops of
his own blood into each socket.
AHAB (cont'd)
Now, three to three, ye stand.
Commend these murderous chalices...
54.
touch them, and ye shall become
parties to an indissoluble league!
The three harpooners clink the sockets together.
AHAB (cont'd)
Drink, my brave harpooners!
Drink and swear, you that stand
the bow of whaleboats!
The harpooners guzzle down the mixed rum and blood,
to the last drop. Ahab glances toward a shocked
Starbuck.
AHAB (cont'd)
Behold, Mister Starbuck! The
deed is done!
(to whole crew)
Drink, all of ye! And swear
DEATH to Moby Dick! May God
hunt us all if we do not hunt
Moby Dick to his death!
The crew, caught up in the moment, down their own
cups -- then BURST INTO SHOUTS, cups raised to their
captain.
CREWMEN
Death to Moby Dick! Death
to Moby Dick!!
Every man of them...the harpooners, Stubb, Flask,
Ishmael, Perth, Dough-Boy, Carpenter, Blacksmith,
little Pip, even Bulkington.
Only Starbuck refrains, away from the crowd.
On the whaleboat, Ahab glances across the ship and
sees Starbuck's aloofness. His dark eyes focus
sharply on him. Long, unsettling looks between them.
A moment of impending conflict.
FADE OUT.
ACT 5
EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - SUNSET
The Pequod drifts on a light wind, her progress slow.
55.
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN -SUNSET
Two polished harpoons reflect the last rays of the
sunset. A spartan cabin, twisted sheets on a bunk.
Hunched over a table scattered with sea charts, Ahab
pores over the four oceans. His pencil traces over a
confused jumble of drawn lines...the courses of whales.
STARBUCK (O.S)
Permission to enter, Captain.
Ahab grunts an affirmative, too preoccupied to look up.
Starbuck enters and waits respectfully, a little tense.
STARBUCK
You sent for me, sir?
AHAB
Mister Starbuck. We are
inexorably bound together for
the duration of this voyage.
You and I are intelligent
men, shippin' with savages.
We need not be strangers.
STARBUCK
I do not wish it, Captain, I
am tied to thee.
AHAB
Good. Good!
He gestures him closer, pointing over his charts.
AHAB
See here, Starbuck. 'Tis the
migratory route of the sperm
whale. No ship ever sailed her
course with one tithe of such
marvelous precision. From the
Azores to St. Helena, around
the Cape, to the Sea of Japan.
Standing close, Starbuck studies Ahab more than the map.
STARBUCK
Time and tide flow wide, sir.
Moby Dick has the round watery
56.
world to swim in.
AHAB
Mister Starbuck, I know his
latitudes, his seasons, the
driftings of his food...
AHAB (cont'd)
I know his sightings, from the
Seychelle ground to Volcano Bay.
STARBUCK
Where lies Nantucket? Ah here...
(points on map)
...where our wives and children
will carry the wee babes up the
hill to catch first glimpse of
these sails. Your wife and son
will be among them, sir.
Ahab's face flinches. A sensitive chord has been struck.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
We must not disappoint them.
I am no crusader after perils,
Captain. My course is set to
return safely home -- with a
full hold. 'Tis the object of
our endeavor.
Ahab looks up impatiently, eying him with darkened brow.
AHAB
Hear me. 'Til this be done,
my boy's face is to me as the
palm of this hand. A lipless,
unfeatured blank. My vengeance,
this very act, was rehearsed by
you and me a billion years
before this ocean rolled.
(draws him near)
All visable objects are but
pasteboard masks, behind which
some unknown but still reasoning
thing puts forth the moldings of
its features. If man will strike,
strike THROUGH the mask! How
else can a prisoner escape but
by thrusting through the wall?
57.
STARBUCK
The white whale is this mask,
sir, this wall?
Ahab paces the room, his peg leg scraping the floor.
AHAB
Aye! He tasks me...he heaps
me...he galls me! I see in him
outrageous strength, inscrutable
malice! THAT is what I hate!
STARBUCK
But vengeance on a dumb brute,
sir! That took your leg from
blindest instinct?!
AHAB
And I'll wreck my hate upon him!
STARBUCK
'Tis madness to be so enraged!
To seek vengeance on a dumb
thing -- 'tis blasphemy!
Ahab turns to confront him, his words charged with fury.
AHAB
BLASPHEMY?! Don't talk to me
of blasphemy, man!
He glares out the window at the sunset, shaking a fist.
AHAB
I would strike the SUN if it
insulted me! What I've dared
I've willed, and what I've
willed I WILL DO!
(turns to him)
You look pale. You think me
mad, don't ye? I'm not mad...
I am madness maddened!
Starbuck stares in utter shock. He shakes his head.
STARBUCK
Sir, I'm not much for fighting
a fish that too much persists
in fighting me. I'm here to
58.
kill whales for my living, not
to be killed by them for theirs.
But...you are the Captain.
AHAB
Aye. I AM the Captain.
EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT
The Pequod drifts through a starry night. A myriad
of moonlit sequins across the water.
INT. FORECASTLE -NIGHT
A besotted crew SINGS WHALING SONGS, sprawled about
tables and bunks like slovenly pirates. Their cups
empty, most of them too drunk to move.
Ishmael wends through them and turns down a corridor.
INT. CORRIDOR -NIGHT
Ishmael passes a doorway into the mates' quarters and
glances inside:
INT. MATES' QUARTERS - NIGHT
A quiet, more civilized scene. Starbuck reads alone
from a bible. Stubb and Flask play a game of Draught.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Ishmael emerges from below and breathes in the sea air.
He looks toward Fedallah and his strange crew: setting
up camp in a spare whaleboat. Bedding and food have been
laid out, as if they were on a different ship from the
rest of the crew. They converse in low, guttural ARABIC.
Ishmael turns to the side for solitude, gazing over the
moonlit sea. Then realizes he's not alone...
Ahab stands some yards away by the bulwark, also gazing
out. He produces a pipe and lights it, cupping the bowl
with bony hands. A ship's lamp casts a flickering light
across his weathered visage.
Ishmael retreats a step into shadow, afraid of the man,
yet fascinated by him.
59.
Unaware of him, Ahab smokes in silence. He takes the
pipe from his mouth and stares at it, shaking his head.
His voice unusually subdued:
AHAB
Old pipe...hard it goes that
even YOUR pleasure is gone.
He gazes up at the bright moon.
AHAB
Time was when the moonlight
soothed me. No more. This
lovely light, it lights me not.
All loveliness is anguish to me
now, since I can never enjoy.
Damned -- most subtly and
malignantly. Damned in the
midst of Paradise!
He starts to turn away -- suddenly winces from a sharp pain
in his severed thigh. He grips the pipe tighter, as if
transferring his anger and pain to the object in his hand.
AHAB
What business have I with
pleasure?! ANY pleasure!...
With sudden disgust, he tosses the pipe overboard.
Hidden in the shadows, Ishmael stares down:
EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT
The pipe tumbles down to sea, its sparks scattering...
extinguished in a sudden FIZZ as it hits the water.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Without another word, Ahab THUNK-CLOPS away. Ishmael
gazes after him, baffled by him.
INT. FORECASTLE -NIGHT
Most of the crew are dead asleep. Ishmael steps quietly
among the cramped bunks. No sound but for men's snores,
the whish of water against the hull.
Ishmael pauses to smile at Queequeg, who sleeps with one
60.
arm clutching his harpoon. He makes his way to his bunk. Stops
to discern another distant SOUND beyond the hull:
An eerie, haunting, watery MELODY from deep in the ocean, miles
away.
Pip is awake on his bunk, ears close to the hull, as he
listens to the mysterious SOUND. Ishmael crouches beside
him, fondly watching the boy. Their eyes meet.
ISHMAEL
Is it mermaids, lad?
PIP
Whales, sir. They're singin'
to each other.
Pip smiles in the dim light. Ishmael returns the smile
and retires into his own bunk, listening too.
WHALE SONGS seem to fill the forecastle's cramped space.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY
A tropical sea under a beating sun. Swells roll over translucent,
turquoise waters. Under full sail, the
Pequod drives to windward.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) -TOPMAST - DAY
Suddenly -- an excited cry from Dagoo on the lookout,
loud and insistent.
DAGOO
There she blows!! There!
There! She BLOWS!!
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Ahab yanks his peg leg out of its anchorage and hauls
up a ladder by his arms alone.
AHAB
Where away?!
DAGOO (O.S.)
On the lee beam, sir! Half
61.
a rifle shot off!
Starbuck, Stubb and Flask rush to the side to look out.
STARBUCK
There go flukes!
STUBB
By thunder! A whole school
of 'em!
The deck becomes a frenzy of activity. Queequeg and
Tashtego emerge from below, harpoons ready.
EXT. TOPMAST - DAY
Dago swings between halyards like a trapeze artist,
slides a hundred feet down -- and alights on the deck.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Fedallah appears at Ahab's side, waiting expectantly.
AHAB
Steward! Fetch me my glass!
The Steward dashes over with an eyeglass. Ahab snatches
it, extends the scope and peers through it, searching.
AHAB
Time! Quick, steward!
STEWARD
Thirteen hours, sir!
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
Viewed through the eyeglass, a dozen whale flukes beat
through the swells, all grey. No white ones.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Ahab snaps the eyeglass closed, disappointed. He pulls
out a small book from his pocket and jots down the hour.
Starbuck hurries up to him.
STARBUCK
Ready to lower boats, sir!
62.
Ahab glances aside, disinterested in the whole business.
AHAB
Aye. Lower away.
Starbuck rushes off. Fedallah SPUTTERS ARABIC to Ahab
with a toothy grin, itching to go out.
AHAB (cont'd)
You too, then.
He turns away, gripping a rail to help his crippled way.
EXT. SHIP'S SIDE - DAY
Cranes are thrust out, line tubs fixed in their places
and whaling boats swung over to be lowered, sailors
working frantically.
Three boats lower fast, chains CLANKING, ropes HISSING,
and splash onto the water. A clamor of SHOUTS, rowers, harpooners
and the three mates scrambling down ladders,
into their respective boats.
A fourth spare boat is lowered by Fedallah's crew, aloof
from the others, working silently and efficiently.
In Starbuck's boat, Ishmael mans the oars with others, brimming
with anticipation of his first whale hunt.
Queequeg attaches rope lines to his harpoons. The
boat casts away from the ship.
Stubb cries out from his boat, as they too cast off.
STUBB
Well, here goes for a cool
dive at death and destruction!
And let the devil fetch the
hindmost!
Casting off in his boat, Flask gestures outward in
dismay.
FLASK
Would ye lookit that?!
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
63.
Fedallah's boat is already rowing out across the water,
way ahead of them.
EXT. SHIP'S SIDE - DAY
STUBB
(mockingly)
There's a pretty fellow now!
Let's give 'em jackals a run
for their money!
All three boats row out at a furious pace.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
A school of sperm whales breach in the rolling sea.
Spouts of misty air. They move at a slow, tranquil
pace, unaware of hunters headed in their direction.
From an airborne view: four boats in pursuit of the
school. Fedallah's remains far in the lead, the other
three racing to catch up, all close together.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT -DAY
Ishmael rows arduously, working up a sweat. He looks
over the rise of a long swell, just in time to see great spouts.
Queequeg, the lead rower, rows like a dynamo,
guiding the pace. Starbuck works the tiller.
STARBUCK
There she blows again, right
ahead, boys...lay back!
He watches the school of whales, then glances back at
the other two boats behind his:
Flask's boat fast approaches, Dagoo at the bow, rowing
with as much power as Queequeg.
EXT. FLASK'S BOAT -DAY
Flask shouts to Starbuck, pointing toward the Arabs'
boat.
FLASK
Who are those devils, sir?!
Did the Capt'n bring 'em along
64.
to make fools of us all!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT -DAY
STARBUCK
Never mind them! Give way,
pull out more to leeward!
Stubb's boat, Tashtego at the bow, pulls ahead.
EXT. STUBB'S BOAT -DAY
Stubb roars with laughter, as his boat passes them.
STUBB
Pull, pull, my children, my
little ones!
(to Flask)
What difference who they are...
they're five more hands come
to help us! More the merrier,
I say! But let's give 'em a
bit of sport!
(to oarsmen)
Snap your oars, you rascals!
Long and strong, ragamuffins,
you sorry rapscallions...give
way! Give way! Pull, pull!
His boat pulls ahead, disappearing behind a tall swell.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT -DAY
Ishmael, rowing exhaustedly near Starbuck, turns to him.
ISHMAEL
What do YOU think of those
new boys, Mister Starbuck?
STARBUCK
Smuggled on board to do Ahab's
personal bidding, I warrant...
(urging them on)
Spring, men, spring! There's
a fortune of oil out there,
swimming right ahead of us!
That's what we came for and
that's our duty! Duty and
profit, hand in hand! Pull!
65.
Their boat drops into a deep trough. Just then, one of
the sperm whales breaches directly in front of them.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Queequeg! Quick!
Queequeg tosses his oar and jumps up to the bow with
his harpoon. Before he has a chance to do anything...
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
Fedallah's boat suddenly appears directly in front of Starbuck's
boat -- surfing down the swell at terrific
speed to intercept the whale!
EXT. FEDALLAH'S BOAT -DAY
Working silently like professional killers, the oarsmen
a powerful lot. Fedallah swiftly takes the harpooner's position
at the bow. The oarsmen stop rowing and, in
perfect unison, lift their oars in the air.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
Fedallah throws his harpoon with deadly force! The
harpoon penetrates the whale's flank, the effect
instantaneous -- the water boils in a raging, bloody
foam, as the whale thrashes in agony!
EXT. FEDALLAH'S BOAT - DAY
Fedallah launches a second harpoon into his stricken
prey with a loud, primitive SHOUT OF TRIUMPH!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT -DAY
A second whale suddenly breaches next to Starbuck's
boat, too close -- its huge body striking the hull!
The boat tips precariously.
STARBUCK
There! There! Give it to
him!
Queequeg manages to thrust out his harpoon from the
violently rocking boat. The harpoon misses.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
66.
Instantly, Flask's boat streaks in for the kill.
EXT. FLASK'S BOAT - DAY
Tashtego quickly raises and slams his harpoon deep
into the body of the huge creature! Blood gushes!
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
The whale's tail jerks upward, catching Flask's boat --
flipping it skyward! Flask and his crew are thrown
high into the churning sea, far from view!
Too close to Starbuck's boat, thrashing flukes slap
down against the water with crashing power -- and
send a wave that almost tips his boat over!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
The force sends the crew spilling into the drink!
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY
Starbuck's men flail about in the turbulent water,
trying to reach their boat.
Ishmael splashes frantically in the watery chaos,
whales all around him. Waves from the slapping tail
plow over him, frothing up water like an eggbeater.
Losing strength, Ishmael sinks beneath the surface!
EXT. UNDERWATER -DAY
Ishmael sinks fast amidst the enormous shapes of
whales, behind him an underwater cloud of blood. Eyes
wide open as he flails, he glimpses an amazing sight:
Across the deep blue, a mother whale with her cub. A
half-dozen bull whales circle protectively around her.
Queequeg suddenly appears from behind -- grabs Ishmael
by the waist and quickly swims back to the surface.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY
67.
Queequeg surfaces with Ishmael in tow. Ishmael spits
out water, coughing and gagging. Fedallah's boat appears,
as if by incarnation.
EXT. FEDALLAH'S BOAT -DAY
Standing proudly in the bow, Fedallah grins down
contemptuously down at Queequeg and Ishmael in the
water. He reaches out and hauls them both into the
boat with superhuman strength. Catching his breath,
Ishmael looks out at the settling sea:
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
A dead, blood-soaked sperm whale floats, fluke out. Fedallah's
kill. A distance off, Starbuck's boat,
men climbing back into her. But not a sign of
Flask's boat.
Stubb's boat drifts into view toward Fedallah's
boat.
EXT. STUBB'S BOAT - DAY
Stubb looms in the stern, his jaw set. Missing all
the action, he's not laughing now. He glances at
the dead whale...then turns his envious eyes on the
grinning Arab. Scanning the horizon of high swells,
Stubb cups his hands and shouts:
STUBB
Flask! You impious old smut!
Where the devil are ye?!
No reply. Just the distant SOUND of CRYING WHALES.
EXT. CARIBBEAN - DAY
The three boats return to ship, Fedallah's boat
towing the dead whale behind it. The hunt is over,
leaving behind a vast sea of blood.
FADE OUT.
ACT 6
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) -QUARTERDECK - DAY
68.
Ahab stands alone at the taffrail, staring out into the horizon.
He barely acknowledges the activity below.
EXT. SHIP'S SIDE - DAY
The giant dead sperm whale is fastened to the hull by
dozens of ropes hauled in by deckhands.
Fedallah jumps on the whale's back like an acrobatic,
using it as a stepping stone to climb aboard.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Fedallah leaps on deck, as Pip dances and tambourines
around him. The old Carpenter bangs a bell with his
hammer, applauding him.
Stubb and Tashtego climb aboard and shoot dagger
looks at the Arab, a mix of admiration and resentment. Fedallah
casually picks his teeth with a tapering,
knife-long fingernail.
They help aboard Ishmael...wet, shivering, in shock.
Then come Starbuck and Queequeg, both soaked to the
bone but composed as if nothing had happened.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Starbuck reports to Ahab at the taffrail, the Captain
gazing seaward as if oblivious.
STARBUCK
Lost a boat, sir. Permission
to send out a search party.
AHAB
Permission denied.
Starbuck is stunned. Ahab just stares out at the
rolling swells.
STARBUCK
Beg pardon, sir??
Ahab slowly raises his arm and points a bony finger
far out to sea, toward the top of a big swell.
Starbuck strains to see out:
69.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY
A floating speck far on the horizon...an overturned
whaleboat. On the upturned bow stands Dagoo. Short
Flask sits on his shoulders, waving his arms like a
semaphore. The rest of the men cling to the boat
from the water.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
AHAB
There, see? There's Mister
Flask...in the middle of a
blinded ocean.
Starbuck peers at the strange sight and shakes his head.
The rest of the crew look out and CHEER. Stubb laughs
heartily. Pip drums his tambourine, dancing a jig.
AHAB (cont'd)
Ye'd better get 'em on board,
Mister Starbuck, before the
sharks discover 'em.
He hobbles away to his cabin. Pip shakes his tambourine
at him, humming a light tune. Ahab glares at him. Pip
stops playing and edges fearfully back. Regarding the
boy thoughtfully, as if noticing him for the first time,
Ahab allows a hint of a smile. Pip dances off.
INT. FORECASTLE -DAY
Men dry off and change clothes. Queequeg rubs down
shivering Ishmael who's still traumatized, his teeth
rattling.
Dagoo and his crew climb below deck, all dripping wet
but cheerful and laughing loudly.
Ishmael turns to Queequeg.
ISHMAEL
Why is everyone so damn merry?
We almost drowned!
QUEEQUEG
70.
Habben all dime, friend! All
dime! Dat is whaling!
Queequeg laughs. It's infectious, and others joins in.
INT. MATES' QUARTERS - DAY
Starbuck and Flask change clothes, while Stub lights
his pipe and Pip collects their wet garments. Flask
strips off a shirt and tosses it sourly.
FLASK
That damned foreign monkey...
takin' our rightful whale like
that!
STUBB
Aye! What manner of creature
is he, anyway?
STARBUCK
A creature from our dreams.
FLASK
How d'ye mean? Like a ghost?
STARBUCK
A devil, perhaps.
STUBB
Man's the devil, all right!
The reason ye can't see his
tail is because he tucks it
out of sight!
PIP
An' it's coiled in his boots!
Stubb laughs at that, ruffling the boy's hair.
FLASK
Did ye hear the way he talks
to the Capt'n in that slithery
tongue? What d'ye suppose
they talk about?
STARBUCK
Striking up a bargain, I'd say.
71.
STUBB
That's it, Starbuck! Ahab's
hard after that white whale,
ain't he? Mebbe that devil is
tryin' to get him to swap away
his silver watch or, or...
STARBUCK
Or his soul.
EXT. QUARTERDECK -NIGHT
Ahab stands on one of his sleepless watches, his whalebone
leg firmly rooted in a peghole. He gazes into the sea, listening
to the exotic HUMMING of a BEDOUIN SONG from Fedallah's crew in
the spare boat.
The only other SOUND comes from the whale carcass tied
alongside the ship...the SAVAGING OF SHARKS.
Ahab turns to observe a commotion below:
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Stubb hastens across the deck, accompanied by the Cook,
Flask, Ishmael and the Carpenter, who carries a lamp
rigged to the wooden staff of a harpoon. Queequeg,
Dagoo and Tashtego follow them with spears and lances.
STUBB
A steak, a steak, by heaven,
before I sleep!
They make their way toward the ship's side to which
the carcass is lashed. All the men look down at the
hump of the whale's immense forehead.
Fedallah silently drifts past them. Startled by him,
Stubb turns to the others with a look of scorn.
STUBB
Ah, now wait, shipmates...
wait! Ain't this the devil
that killed the whale?
72.
He bows mockingly to Fedallah, who returns a skeletal
grin.
STUBB (cont'd)
The harpooner's choice of
steak, eh? Is that what ye
came for?
Ignoring him, Fedallah spits down at the carcass of the
whale with pure contempt. Tauntingly, he steps up to the
gold coin on the mast and taps it, as if it were already
his. Then returns to his crew in the spare boat.
Stubb laughs and leans over the bulwark. He takes the
harpoon-lamp from the Carpenter and shines it down on
the ferocious scene below: sharks in a feeding frenzy,
ripping at the dead whale.
STUBB
Well, that foreign devil may
care not for whale steaks,
but I'll eat this fish in
one mouthful!
(to harpooners)
Ready, boys...
Stubb throws the harpoon-lamp -- impaling it into the
whale's forehead. Queequeg, Dagoo and Tashtego leap
over the side.
EXT. WHALE CARCASS - NIGHT
They land on the giant whale's head, Queequeg and
Dagoo carrying sharp cutting spears. They climb down
toward the tail, while Tashtego keeps guard against
the sharks with lances in both hands.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Ishmael leans over the bulwark, staring awestruck
at the infernal scene and the intrepid harpooners.
STUBB
Just the tender bits, boys!
EXT. WHALE CARCASS - NIGHT
Queequeg and Dagoo BARK SIGNALS to each other as
they struggle their way to the tail of the carcass.
73.
Despite their precarious position, the slippery whale
and the unpredictable swells, Queequeg and Dagoo cut
into the lower part of the whale's tail. Queequeg
slices out a large chunk of red meat, when...
An enormous shark lunges out of the water at him!
It almost snatches the bloody meat -- but Queequeg
tosses it to Dagoo.
Queequeg slips and starts to slide down the tail
section -- directly toward the massive jaws of the
shark! He slams his cutting spear into the whale
and pulls himself up.
Tashtego spears the shark. A quick, thrashing death.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Ahab observes the antics of his men below with half
a smile. Then returns to his watch, gazing dead to
sea like a stone sentinel.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
The harpooners have returned, the others all huddled
around something. Stubb pushes his way in between
them, as we move in to reveal: five whale steaks,
sizzling on a rudimentary grill.
Behind the grill, the Cook works fast, sprinkling
whole spices on the meat, chopping them directly
onto the barbecued steaks.
STUBB
Be quick about it, cook! I'm
famished!
COOK
Awright, awright, don't be in
such a bleedin' rush...
He forks out a couple of steaks onto two wood plates.
Stubb reaches for a plate.
STUBB (cont'd)
This one's for the Capt'n...
He takes it away, hurrying up onto the quarterdeck.
74.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Stubb respectfully offers the plate of steaming meat.
STUBB
Capt'n, sir. Would ye care
to have first honors, sir?
Ahab shakes his head gravely, not veering from his
watch. Stubb shrugs and climbs back down.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Stubb sits down with Flask at a makeshift table,
complete with napkins, knives and forks. In b.g.,
Ishmael, the Carpenter and the harpooners hungrily
watch the ceremony. The two officers dig into their
steaks with relish, Stubb leaning over in a low voice:
STUBB (cont'd)
Poor Capt'n. The whale eats
him, 'stead of him eatin' the
whale.
Flask listens to the shark's savagings, annoyed.
FLASK
Blast those critters...they're
kicking up such a shindy I'm
losin' me appetite!
At the grill, the Cook forks out the last three steaks
onto a platter. The Carpenter steps over and gloats
at them with salivating eyes.
CARPENTER
Cook, lemme have one o' those,
will ye?
COOK
Are ye daft?! Officers only.
CARPENTER
But there's three steaks!
COOK
Aye, one's a second helpin' fer
Stubb, one's for me.
75.
CARPENTER
That's one left, ain't it?!
COOK
That one's for me too.
CARPENTER
Have a heart, damn ye!
The Cook irritably grabs a cutting spear from Queequeg.
COOK
Ye want a steak?! Go get it
yerself!
CARPENTER
Wot?! Down there?!
COOK
G'won then!
He shoves the spear into his hand. The Carpenter stares
anxiously down over the bulwark. Everyone watches him considering
it. Hesitating, he climbs over the rail with arthritic slowness.
Then freezes on the bulwark, looking
down fearfully at the loudly thrashing sharks.
FLASK
G'won, what're ye waitin' for?!
The Carpenter looks back. The Cook nods mockingly.
COOK
An' tell 'em to be quiet while
yer at it!
Stubb, Ishmael and the others all burst out laughing.
Humiliated, the Carpenter glares at the Cook's vulgar
grin. Down below, SPLASHING SOUNDS from two fighting
sharks -- the Carpenter jumps back off the rail in holy terror.
An explosion of laughter all around.
EXT. MIDDECK -DAY
A complex whale-processing factory is under way: the
carving of a dead whale and the melting of its blubber.
The whale's skin is peeled up from the floating carcass
by chains and pulleys from the lower masthead on a huge blubber
hook. Like a peeled orange, the skinned whale
76.
rolls over and over in the water.
The deck careens from the tremendous weight. Sailors
crowd the windlass, tugging and turning it, singing:
CREWMEN
Our captain stood upon the deck,
A spy glass in his hand,
A viewin' of those gallant whales
That blew at every strand!
Other deckhands slice tons of blubber into huge chunks
with mincing spades.
They haul them to the try-works, two giant pots on iron furnaces.
Smoke billows and flames lick out, as the Blacksmith feeds wood
into the open furnaces.
The blubber chunks are pitched into the scalding pots
to be boiled down, as the men sing on:
CREWMEN (cont'd)
Your tubs in your boats, boys,
And by your braces stand,
We'll have one of those whales,
Hand, boys, over hand!
Large barrels are filled with gallons of whale oil,
sealed and rolled down the gaping maw of a bow hatch
into the barrel hold, deep in the bowels of the ship.
CREWMEN (cont'd)
So be cheery, my lads!
May heart your hearts never fail!
While the bold harpooner
Is striking the whale!
The deck plankings stream with freshets of oil and
blood, littered horrifically with bones and blubber.
During all this labor, Fedallah and his Arabs recline
lazily in the spare boat, oblivious to everyone.
Scowling at the lollygaggers, Flask turns to Stubb.
FLASK
Lookit 'em devils, Stubb...
idlin' away while the rest of
us slave! I got a good mind
to stove their boat and send
'em to Davy Jones!
77.
EXT. MAIN MAST - DAY
High aloft in the rigging, Ishmael paints the spars with
tar. Queequeg does the same beside him, both of them
hanging precariously over a fifty-foot drop. His hands
healed and strong, Ishmael no longer shows any fear.
Below him, a crow's nest view: a deck swathed in gore.
Revolted by the sight, Ishmael shakes his head woefully.
ISHMAEL
Heaven help us...we're the
vultures of the sea.
QUEEQUEG
No sabbee what-ee mean.
ISHMAEL
I mean there's no savagery of
beasts that's not infinitely
outdone by that of men.
His eyes fall on: Ahab, emerging from his cabin,
loaded down with charts, his log book and a quadrant.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Ahab sets the charts and book on a capstan, raises
the quadrant to his eye. Then he spreads the charts
out, opens the log book, reads from it, checks the
charts and reads again. All with a frantic edge.
Giving up, he paces like a caged beast, PEG-LEGGING
from port to starboard, ignoring the middeck hustle
and bustle. Starbuck approaches him, clearly
agitated.
STARBUCK
Sir! I must request that
ye put those foreign boys to
work. Their slovenliness is
affectin' the morale of the
crew.
Ahab keeps pacing, as if not hearing him, scanning the
sea with murderous frustration. Starbuck shifts over
to block his way, adamant.
78.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Did ye not hear me, Captain?
Ahab stops to glare at him, his jaw tight.
AHAB
They're not here to tend ship,
or any other business, Mister
Starbuck. None but one single
purpose -- to hunt down and
slay Moby Dick!
Starbuck starts to reply, but an OUTCRY interrupts him:
LOOKOUT (O.S.)
Sail ho! Sail to larboard!
Excited murmurs spread among the men, as they race
toward the port side to view a distant vessel in b.g.
The Steward materializes with the eyeglass and hands
it to Ahab, who grabs it and takes a quick look at
the ship.
AHAB
English.
He lowers the eyeglass, deliberating to himself.
AHAB (cont'd)
Prepare for visitors.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
The two whaling ships, of almost identical design, heave
to and drift side by side.
A small boat rows toward the Pequod. The other ship
bears the name "SAMUEL ENDERBY". From her deck, the
SOUNDS of ACCORDION MUSIC and FESTIVE REVELRY.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) -MIDDECK - DAY
The Pequod crew hugs the bulwarks to view the Enderby's
distant deck:
79.
EXT. ENDERBY (AT SEA) - DAY
A wild celebration seems to be taking place on board.
SAILORS are drinking and carousing, dancing with
beautiful, colorfully attired POLYNESIAN GIRLS.
In sharp contrast to the somber Pequod, it's a ship
of laughter and joy.
FADE OUT.
ACT 7
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK - DAY
Viewed from our deck: the happy, drunken Enderby crew
crowd the bulwarks, facing us. They wave flasks of
grog, SHOUTING across and gesturing us to join them.
Scanning across the faces of our crewmen, we see the
eager anticipation of licking lips and ogling eyes.
Ishmael gawks at the LAUGHING native girls, their
voices like sweet music. Queequeg nods knowingly
to himself, a nostalgic look.
Sunning in the whaleboat, only Fedellah's crew shows
no interest.
Flask turns to Stubb, unable to take his eyes off
the girls.
FLASK
Heaven seize me, that's a
purty sight! A man forgets
how awful lonesome it gets
out here.
STUBB
Aye. Those crack fellows
have done well for themselves.
Starbuck smiles at the men. Beside him, Ahab sees and
hears nothing but the ENDERBY CAPTAIN climbing up the
ship's side with his ESCORTS. Starbuck turns to Ahab.
STARBUCK
Permission to lower boats,
sir. The boys deserve a
short gam.
80.
AHAB
Permission denied.
STARBUCK
(surprised)
But, sir. It's expected...
Ignoring him, Ahab faces the Enderby Captain climbing
aboard with a one-handed grip. A stout-bellied man of
relaxed authority, island garlands around his neck.
AHAB
Welcome aboard the Pequod,
sir. I'm Captain Ahab. You
are a whaling ship, I see.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Aye, Captain! Thank you. I'm
Captain Dowling.
He reaches out a right hand to shake his hand, his
left hand behind his back. Ahab nods with stubborn
gloom, finding this man too jolly for his taste.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN (cont'd)
We're a full ship, sir, and
homeward bound!
AHAB
I'm an empty ship and outward
bound.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Then we'll bring ye good luck!
My boys even won themselves a
few brides from the Fiji Isles,
as you can see...
Impatient with this ceremony, Ahab gets to the point.
AHAB
Hast thou seen a WHITE WHALE?
The Enderby Captain grins at Ahab, mischievously.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
THE white whale, d'you mean?
Moby Dick, as some call him?
81.
Ahab twitches, a shocked beat. Before he can reply,
the Enderby Captain swings out his other arm from
behind -- a white whale-bone arm with a hook.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN (cont'd)
See you this?
Ahab studies the arm with astonishment, then lifts
his eyes to the Englishman's playful expression,
who glances down at Ahab's peg leg.
AHAB
Ha! You've an arm that cannot
hold and I've a leg that cannot
run!
(eyes narrowing)
The white whale?
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
The white whale.
All the crew turn to stare at his whalebone limb.
AHAB
HE took that arm off, did he?
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
And that leg, too?
Understanding silence between them. Unexpectedly,
the Enderby Captain laughs uproariously.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
A great, bouncing whale, was
he?! Old as Genesis, with a
milky white head?!
AHAB
(seething inside)
Harpoons sticking in all over
his hump?!
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Aye! And in a boiling rage!
AHAB
Mine! MY harpoons!
He can barely contain his rage.
82.
AHAB (cont'd)
Tell me, sir! Tell me what
happened!
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
(gestures at his arm)
Oh, a shocking bad wound it
was, Capt'n Ahab! My surgeon
did his damndest but he had
to cut it off soon as it went
black! Thank the stars I
brought me wife on the voyage!
She's been a great comfort
to me--
AHAB
What about the WHITE WHALE?!
His black look kills the Englishman's merriment, who
regards him oddly.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Well, to the point, after he
stove my boats, we didn't see
him again for some time.
AHAB
Did you cross his wake again,
is what I'm askin'?!
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Twice.
AHAB
Are you saying that ye could
not...fasten?!
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Why would I WANT to?! Isn't
one limb enough? That white
monster doesn't bite -- he
SWALLOWS!
Reacting, Ishmael and the other men look on with horror.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN (cont'd)
I have a wife on board and
a profitable homecoming!
Why should I take the risk?
83.
A beat, Ahab pacing agitatedly as the man chatters on.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN (cont'd)
No thank you, no more white
whales for me! He's best
left alone, don't you think?
Ahab's eyes enlarge, turning to him with great contempt.
AHAB
He is, but he'll be hunted for
all that, sir! What's best
left alone is not always what
least invites! Like a cursed
magnet is that whale to me,
d'ye understand?! How long
since you saw him last?
The Enderby Captain squints at Ahab, then laughs.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Bless my soul, sir! Your blood's
at the boiling point!
His laughter is short-lived. Ahab suddenly spins around
to Starbuck.
AHAB
Mister Starbuck, prepare to
make way. We've wasted enough
time!
(to Enderby Captain)
Good day, Captain!
Ahab stomps toward the helm. After a bewildering pause,
the Enderby Captain looks at Starbuck.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
What's the matter with him?!
Has he lost his senses?
STARBUCK
No offense, I'm sure, sir...
it's no doubt the pain in his
bleeding stump.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Hmphh! The man's mad!
84.
He turns indignantly away to deboard, signaling his men.
ENDERBY CAPTAIN (cont'd)
Away, boys! I'll not spend
another moment on this ship...
Starbuck stares after the Englishman, not moving. All
around him, the crew is frozen in stunned amazement.
AHAB
Mister Starbuck, did ye not
hear me?! Prepare to sail!
Starbuck stares angrily back at him, rooted to the spot. Ishmael
and the rest gaze anxiously away at the NOISY
celebration aboard the Enderby, deprived of their
much-needed furlough.
The Enderby Captain climbs to his boat, shouting up:
ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Do not be a fool, Capt'n! Do
not pursue Moby Dick, I warn
ye! Beware, sir, he's a demon!
(thunderously)
Beware the BLASPHEMER'S END!
AHAB
Curses throttle ye...
(shouts down)
Starbuck! Set sail, I say!
Obey me, damn ye! NOW!
Starbuck turns to the crew, a walking powderkeg.
STARBUCK
Man the sheets! Jump to it!
The deck becomes a flurry. Sailors scramble about
and climb the masts to unfurl sails. Many of them
glance toward the Enderby with open discontent.
As everyone works, a tense undertone of mutiny.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY
From afar, the two ships part in opposite directions.
85.
The Pequod drives hard to southerly winds. A ship
alone on the blue-green expanse.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK -DAY
Ishmael tightens a halyard at the main mast. Stubb
fixes a brace beside him. Ishmael glances at the
glistening gold coin hammered to the mast, then looks
away toward the Captain:
Ahab is at his usual watch facing dead to windward,
brooding with stormy thoughts.
ISHMAEL
I fear the old man's a little
out of his wits.
Flask passes by, darting a disgruntled glance at Ahab.
FLASK
Blast his eyes...he has no
heart!
STUBB
Agh, I've seen worse. Better
to sail with a moody good
captain than a merry bad one.
Pip sits on a capstan with his untouched tambourine,
watching the ill mood around him.
Perth and Dough-Boy swab the deck, SQUABBLING AD-LIB
with each other in low, angry voices.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Starbuck draws near Ahab, determined to speak his mind.
STARBUCK
Captain Ahab, sir--
AHAB
Not now! Leave me be.
Exasperated, Starbuck glares at him and turns away.
He looks down to witness a scene below:
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
86.
Perth dumps a swab bucket and splashes Dough-Boy.
A fight quickly breaks out! Perth pulls a knife --
until Stubb grabs his wrist and yanks it away.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Drawn to the commotion, Ahab leans over the bridge
rail with Starbuck.
AHAB
Trouble there, Second Mate?
STUBB
Nothin' of concern, sir.
Ahab turns away. Starbuck talks to his back, persistent:
STARBUCK
The men are out of sorts.
We may not see another ship
for months, Captain, and it
does not bode well that we
deprive 'em of even a little
recreation.
AHAB
They are whalers, Mister
Starbuck. This is not a
society ball.
The Steward rings the watch bell, breaking the tension.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Stubb pushes the knife back to Perth, low-voiced.
STUBB
Get below, Perth!
PERTH
He started it--
STUBB
Quiet! Go swab the foc'sle
'til ye learn your manners!
Perth struts sullenly away.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
87.
Starbuck stares intently at the Captain's back. Ahab
turns and gives him a dismissing look.
AHAB
To your duties, Starbuck.
STARBUCK
Aye, aye...SIR.
INT. FORECASTLE - DAY
Fetching a bucket, Perth extracts a hidden flask from
under his bunk. He sneaks a long, deep swig.
Starbuck barrels downstairs, in a foul state of mind.
STARBUCK
Perth!
Perth quickly reconceals his cache and grabs the bucket.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Get aloft to the lookout!
PERTH
But it ain't my watch, sir.
STARBUCK
I want ye where I can see ye.
Perth drops the bucket and ambles disgruntledly toward
the stairs, a little drunk.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Get along, ye shabby rascal,
or I'll give ye a whale-bonin'!
PERTH
Ye needn't speak so harshly--
Starbuck shoves him up the steps.
STARBUCK
On your way!
EXT. MASTHEAD - DAY
88.
High aloft, Perth climbs the main mast to the lookout,
GRUMBLING to himself all the way.
He looks down to see Starbuck crossing the deck and
scowls down at him.
PERTH
Damned St. Jago monkey...
Inches above him, a loose hoisting block dangles and
swings precariously in the breeze.
Sneering downward, Perth spits toward the deck.
PERTH (cont'd)
May God sink the lot of ye!
A squall picks up. Perth turns back up -- the block
hits him square in the face! Dazed, he lets go the
ropes...
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Crossing the deck, Starbuck stops to hear...
A sudden SCREAM from above! Everyone looks up at...
Perth's plummeting figure! He CRASHES DOWN on the
deck with full impact -- right in front of Starbuck!
Deckhands rush to Perth, lying in a twisted sprawl.
His neck broken.
Starbuck looks on in horror.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - SUNSET
A blood-red sunset and spectacular, billowing clouds
frame the Pequod...her sails furled.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK - SUNSET
A sail-swathed corpse rests on a bulwark board. A
somber crew gathers around the ship's side, their set
faces aglow in the sunset. The Captain and the three
mates stand by the bulwark around the body.
89.
Ahab opens a bible to begin reading. Strangely, he
can't bring himself to speak the printed words before
him. He gruffly hands the bible over to Starbuck.
Frowning at him, Starbuck reads the last rites:
STARBUCK
"They go down to the sea in
ships, that do business in
great waters. These see the
works of the Lord and his
wonders in the deep"...
EXT. TOPMAST - SUNSET
Perched high aloft, Ishmael witnesses the sea burial
below, sun and wind burning his face.
EXT. MIDDECK - SUNSET
In the spare whaleboat, Fedallah and his Arabs pass
around a hooker pipe, oblivious to the Christian
ceremony. Fedallah exhales smoke with languid
disregard.
Starbuck finishes the rites in his own words:
STARBUCK
Lord of all the seas, we here
commend this mariner's spirit
into thy hands...
He nods to Stubb and Flask, and they tip the bulwark
board...Perth's body drops into the sea with a small
SPLASH. And disappears into its watery grave.
A long beat, as the men gaze down.
AHAB
So be it, then. We're born
in throes, 'tis only fit that
we should live in pains and
die in pangs...only to end in
an unmarked grave.
Starbuck, a tinderbox of bitter emotions, mutters to
him in a low voice:
90.
STARBUCK
To what end might that be,
sir? To a "blasphemer's end,"
as the English captain said?
Ahab glares at him with a blackened brow. Starbuck
shuts the bible and gazes back, trying nobly to
contain himself.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Life holds US, sir. We do
not hold IT.
Ahab faces him, raising his voice for all to hear.
AHAB
Do ye dare to question me?!
STARBUCK
I don't dare, sir, I only
think. I blame myself for
this good sailor's death...
AHAB
A careless sailor!
STARBUCK
Perhaps. But the men see it
as an ill prophecy.
AHAB
Prophecy?!
He wheels about to face the crew. All around, the men
edge fearfully back.
AHAB (cont'd)
PROPHECY?!
He scans their faces...ignorant, superstitious faces.
AHAB (cont'd)
I'll give ye a prophecy, my
shipmates. Death to Moby Dick!
Aye! I'll be both a prophet
and fulfiller then!
He THUNK-CLOPS between them, moving from face to face
91.
with a quickening pace and rising voice to galvanize
them. Starbuck watches him gravely.
AHAB (cont'd)
And the fulfillment of this
prophecy is what ye have all
agreed to share with me!
(a raised fist)
Death to my dismemberer --
to Moby Dick! That's more
than even the greatest GODS
could do, I tell ye!
His effect on them is hypnotic, his passion burning
with redoubled fury as he shouts:
AHAB (cont'd)
The gods've knocked me down,
they've mocked this captive
king -- but I am up again!
Now it is THEY who take to
their heels and run! Hiding
from ME!
Wild-eyed, Ahab turns to glower defiantly at the
cloudy, red sunset.
AHAB (cont'd)
Come! Come out behind your
cotton clouds! Come and
strike ME! I have no long
guns to reach ye -- only
THESE!
(raises his hands)
My bony fingers! Come then!
See if ye can swerve me!
Ahab laughs defiantly and faces Starbuck with fire in
his eyes, shaking a fist at him.
AHAB (cont'd)
Swerve ME?! Ye cannot swerve
me! Else ye swerve yourself...
EXT. TOPMAST - SUNSET
On his lookout, Ishmael watches the drama below. Then,
unexpectedly, something distracts him out to sea:
92.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - SUNSET
An immense white whale plunges through distant waters,
a tall jet of misty air blowing out of his spout!
EXT. TOPMAST - SUNSET
Ishmael gapes seaward. He can't believe his eyes.
He tries to shout out but can only gasp, his words a
stammered hush. He's speechless...
EXT. MIDDECK - SUNSET
Pacing around Starbuck, Ahab raises his fist to the
heavens.
AHAB (cont'd)
Swerve me?! Never! The
path to my purpose is laid
with iron rails -- on which
my very soul is grooved
to run!
(to Starbuck)
And NAUGHT will stop me,
Mister Starbuck!...
Suddenly Ishmael's VOICE BOOMS OUT at the top of his
lungs:
ISHMAEL (O.S.)
Thar she blows!! She blows
to starboard!!
(loud and clear)
The WHITE WHALE!!
A stunned beat. Ahab charges past Starbuck -- bounds
onto the quarterdeck.
The men bolt to the starboard bulwark, hugging the
sides, peering seaward:
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA -SUNSET
Nothing there. Only a flat expanse under the sinking
sun.
93.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - SUNSET
Ahab stares furiously outward, willing him to appear.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - SUNSET
Still nothing. Then suddenly, he breaches...
MOBY DICK! The mighty, feared leviathan himself!
Mangled iron harpoons protrude out from a pale skin
mottled with scars and barnacles.
EXT. QUARTERDECK -SUNSET
Ahab's face starts to convulse!
EXT. MIDDECK - SUNSET
The ship's crew are speechless, all eyes fixed on
the awesome sight of the white whale.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA -SUNSET
MOBY DICK dips down his great white head and begins
slowly to dive for the deep. The last visible sign
of him is his tail.
ISHMAEL (O.S.)
There go flukes!!
The enormous split jib tail rises up, higher and
higher -- then slaps the water defiantly! Then
disappears.
EXT. QUARTERDECK -SUNSET
Ahab's hands grip the bulwark, his knuckles white.
The scar down the side of his head looks swollen
and reddened by the sky's orange glow. His face
tightens like a coil, until he finally EXPLODES...
A BELLOWING HOWL OF UNGODLY RAGE!
FADE OUT.
94.
END PART ONE
85
PART TWO
FADE IN:
ACT 1
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
A boundless seascape, the tiny Pequod far in b.g.
Beyond, the orange sun disappears below the horizon.
In f.g., a huge white mass surfaces with jarring
suddenness -- MOBY DICK, a hundred feet of scarred,
barnacled tonnage! The spout from his forehead
blows out a geyser of mist, clouding our view.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - TOPMAST - DUSK
High on the lookout, Ishmael points excitedly.
ISHMAEL
There she blows again! Hard
to port beam!
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DUSK
Ahab, his blazing eyes fixed on the distant whale,
suddenly reels about with an earth-shaking roar:
AHAB
Clear away the boats!!
STARBUCK
In the night, Captain?!
AHAB
Clear away, I said!
STARBUCK
Ye want us to give him chase
in the NIGHT?!
AHAB
Aye! In the night -- we'll
give chase by night and see
his whiteness better than by
daylight!
86
Starbuck hesitates. Ahab turns hard to him.
AHAB (cont'd)
Order the men, Starbuck!
STARBUCK
Aye, aye sir...
(to the men)
Prepare to lower away boats!
EXT. MIDDECK - DUSK
Jarred from their astonished stares, the crewmen
scramble into action. Ishmael rope-slides to the
deck like an expert seaman. Pip runs the length of
the ship, shaking his tambourine, yelling excitedly.
Ahab strides toward the main mast and stops in front
of the nailed gold coin. He bangs a fist on it.
AHAB
My harpooners...strike and
the gold will be yours!
Tashtego looks up from a loggerhead, feeding out
line. He raises his harpoon like an Apache warrior.
TASHTEGO
WOO-HAA-HEE! Aye, Capt'n!
Dat Moby Dick come near Tash
an' he be a dead fish!
Dagoo leaps into a boat, lines wrapped around his
shoulders and tied to his two harpoons, one in each
hand. He lifts them high, a flash of teeth.
DAGOO
KEE-HA! KEE-HA! He might
see a white man by night --
but not Dagoo! I'll kill
'im for ye, Capt'n, and win
that gold!
Fedallah snickers at him from the spare boat, shaking
his head with a self-confident sneer.
Queequeg leaps onto the bulwark with raised harpoon.
QUEEQUEG
87
Smoke out him pipes me will!
Make-em straight dat crooked
jaw!
Ahab tosses a lance at Queequeg, who takes it on the
fly with a powerful war cry:
QUEEQUEG (cont'd)
HALA-LA PAO-LOO! FA-TONGA!
In the bustle, Pip sneaks through the boarding gate
and climbs unseen over the side.
All the whalers pile en masse into the lowering boats.
EXT. SHIP'S SIDE - DUSK
Four whaleboat keels hit the water in tandem -- one
quick SPLASH-DOWN after another.
Ahab, full of sudden youthful energy, swings over the
side on a halyard and rope-climbs down fast toward
Fedallah's boat. His hands slip the last few feet --
he falls hard into the boat with a CRUNCH! He tries
to stand, but he can't. His peg leg is splintered.
The crew turns to Ahab's SHOUT OF RAGE, ringing out
in the dusk. An Arab rower tries to help him. Ahab
pushes him away. He picks up pieces of his jaggedly
broken peg leg, tosses them into the water. Hobbles
his way to the stern, booming to his rowers:
AHAB
START her, men! Start her
like thunderclaps! Like
a thousand grinning devils!
The Arabs row out like demons possessed. Fedallah
takes his place at the bow, silent and stealthy.
Ishmael and Starbuck watch Ahab from their boat...
unaware of little Pip, climbing over its stern.
He slithers under a box plank and hides behind a
loggerhead basket. Starbuck turns around.
STARBUCK
Crack on! Pull those oars!
88
Ishmael takes an oar, Bulkington beside him.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
An aerial view over moonlit waters: four whaling
boats, lit by pole lanterns. One in the lead,
three fanned out behind it.
To the horizon...a formidable white shape glides
off into a fog bank.
EXT. STUBB'S BOAT - DUSK
Stubb lights his pipe, as his men row furiously.
STUBB
Go, lads, row like the wind!
He looks toward Ahab's boat: streaking far ahead.
Starbuck's boat glides by. Stubb turns aside.
STUBB (cont'd)
Who'd have thought it, eh?!
At night, to boot! If I had
only one leg, ye wouldn't
catch ME in a boat by night...
unless maybe to stop a leak
with a whalebone toe!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
Starbuck turns to Stubb's boat, shaking his head.
STARBUCK
He's possessed, I tell ye!
God has shipwrecked his soul!
The boats plunge into a fog bank, enveloped in a
moonlit mist.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Look at this! A fog! Where
did it come from?! An' look
at us -- rowin' blind in the
night, after a whale as white
as this fog! Was it a whale
we saw, or a ghost?!
89
Rowing before him, Ishmael looks up at the moon:
An opaque eye in the thick mists, its glow surreal.
EXT. FLASK'S BOAT - DUSK
Flask's boat passes beside Starbuck's.
FLASK
It was Moby Dick, all right!
Fog, snow or hail, I don't
care -- I'll fetch that gold
doubloon or die tryin'!
(to rowers)
Pull, damn ye! Show some
muscle!
Dagoo sings a rhythmic AFRICAN CHANT, the oarsmen
echoing him, rowing to his beat.
Ahead of them: Ahab's boat materializes out of
the dense fog, moving steadily forward.
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
Ahab stands stiffly by the tiller, using it as both
crutch and guide. He grips a rower's head of hair
to keep his balance, glaring ahead into the white
night as if he could see through the fog. A manic
energy in his furrowed-brow concentration.
AHAB
Roar and pull, ye devils...
I can see fifty seas off! A
hundred seas! It's Moby Dick
out there, I tell ye! Chase!
Crack your backbones, bite
your knives in two!
(clasping forehead)
Dear Lord, I'm going to go
stark staring mad...
(exhorting on)
Close to, ye hairy-hearted
ghouls, get me close to him!
The Arabs HUM as they row, an odd, syncopated SOUND.
Fedallah stands motionless at the bow, harpoon ready.
90
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
Starbuck stares ahead at Ahab with deep chagrin.
Ishmael rows, his sweaty face glistening under the
boat lamps. Behind the basket next to him, Pip
crouches in hiding.
The sea becomes strangely still. Starbuck glances
around him.
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
A deathly quiet, only the SLAP of oars against the
water. Beyond...DISTANT GURGLING SOUNDS. Ahab
tenses.
AHAB
Hark! Prick ears...listen!
EXT. FLASK'S BOAT - DUSK
FLASK
Hold the oars! Hold still!
The men raise their oars and look out into the
luminous night. Dagoo commands the bow, taking
a firm grip of his harpoon.
EXT. STUBB'S BOAT - DUSK
Stubb cups an ear, shifting the pipe in his
mouth, tuned into every sound around him. His
voice hushed:
STUBB
Softly, softly...whoa, babes!
Still now!
The rowers stop rowing and lift up their oars.
Tashtego readies himself at the bow.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
The becalmed waters around the boat spin in rivulets. Starbuck's
voice cuts the air like a knife:
91
STARBUCK
Stop!
The rowers lift their oars and freeze.
Ahead in the fog: Ahab's boat drifts soundlessly.
Ishmael listens, unsettled by the stillness around
him. He turns nervously to Starbuck.
ISHMAEL
What d'ye make of it, sir--
STARBUCK
Hist! Eyes sharp...
Everyone watches and listens. A long, tense beat...
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
The fog begins to lift...a full view of all four
boats. Whalers listen to the eerie quiet.
A calm, empty sea. Then, GURGLINGS all around...
A SCHOOL OF SPERM WHALES breaches -- a full circle
around the boats! With a great SIGH, dozens of
spouts release jets of watery air!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
Starbuck spins his head around -- whales everywhere!
Ishmael stares amazed, slack-jawed. Queequeg bolts
to the bow with his harpoon.
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
Ahab spins around, loses his balance and falls. He
rises quickly, glaring beyond the black shapes all
around him...then points outside the gentle fleet
of whales, his finger like a fixed bayonet.
AHAB
There! THERE!
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
92
MOBY DICK breaches with a tremendous jump -- three
times the size of the other whales! Then swims
steadily away.
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
Ahab crashes his way toward the bow...
AHAB
Row, you monkeys -- ROW!
He seizes Fedallah's harpoon and rushes forward...
AHAB (cont'd)
Move aside...
He stumbles and falls, keeps going frantically...
AHAB (cont'd)
...LET ME GIVE IT TO HIM!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
A sperm whale suddenly breaches half under the boat
with a HARD BUMP, lifting it up! The boat slides off
its back, landing upright in the water next to it.
Wasting no time, Queequeg thrusts his harpoon with
great power -- WHISH! Deep into the whale's hump!
A giant's GRUNT, followed by a thrashing tail,
slapping the water beside them! Instant chaos...
STARBUCK
Stern all, stern all! Quick!
The oarsmen immediately row away from the agonizing
whale and its deadly flukes.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Give him another, Queequeg!
Queequeg aims, throws another harpoon into the mountain
of thrashing blubber -- another deadly hit!
The whale's spout gushes spasmodically. The air fills
with bloody mist, spraying the whalers red as they row
frantically away from the sea beast's death throes.
93
The whale starts to dive. Harpoon lines spin out of
the loggerhead basket -- rolls of line uncoil rapidly,
the basket shaking violently!
Unnoticed by the others, frightened Pip scrambles
out from beneath the box plank and stumbles into the
basket -- his little legs tangled in spinning lines!
Queequeg lets loose a WAR CRY at the fast-receding
whale. Ishmael jumps to his feet, straining to get
a look...
A QUICK, TINY SCREAM startles him from behind!
Pip suddenly squirts out past him, dragged by a line
and yanked overboard -- into the churning water!
ISHMAEL
Man overboard, Mister
Starbuck! Man overboard!
He quickly throws a lifebuoy to the boy. Starbuck
sees what's happened, but he's too distracted.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
For God's sake...it's PIP,
sir! He's out there!
The boat suddenly lurches forward -- dragged at
great speed by the wounded, diving whale. The
running lines around a stanchion start to smoke.
STARBUCK
Wet the line! Wet the line!
Queequeg dumps a bucket of water over the smoking
rope. The boat vibrates with the power of the drag.
Gripping the tiller, Starbuck quickly scans around him.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
The circle of panicking whales tightens around the
three boats, Ahab's moving beyond it. Starbuck's boat
is pulled deeper into the fray.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
94
Queequeg snatches up a lance and points urgently at
the taut lines.
QUEEQUEG
Me cut-em, sir?! Cut dem
lines 'fore we be splintered
up by dem whales?!
STARBUCK
NO! Not yet...look!
He points forward.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
An opening between the circling whales, out toward the
calm, moonlit sea. The boat flies through the gap.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
Ishmael turns and looks far astern:
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
Pip clings to the floating lifebuoy, floundering in
the eruption of white water all around him. The boy
SCREAMS INAUDIBLY, waving a frantic arm for help.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
Ishmael turns to Starbuck in a panic.
ISHMAEL
Sir! What about Pip--
Beside him, Bulkington grips his arm.
BULKINGTON
Sit down, boy. Nothin' we can
do.
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
Ahab hangs over the prow, harpoon held before him
with fixed intensity. Dead ahead:
95
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
Outward bound, the white whale swims steadily and
obliviously...still too far to strike.
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
AHAB
ROW! ROW! ROW!!
He glares back at the other boats, but they're too
far away to offer any support. He looks forward:
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
MOBY DICK's giant flukes rise up in the moonlit air,
then drop quickly into the calm water...disappearing
into the deep blue. He's gone.
Ahab GROWLS with monumental frustration.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
The lines go slack, and the boat suddenly slows.
Ishmael jumps up, unable to suppress himself.
ISHMAEL
Mister Starbuck, sir! We
can't just act as if nothing
has happened! We've GOT to
go back for him!
STARBUCK
Sit down! SIT, I tell you,
before ye wind up in the
water too!
ISHMAEL
But he'll drown if we don't
go back!
Starbuck pushes Ishmael back onto the rowers' bench.
STARBUCK
Take back that oar, sailor!
We've got other business to
attend to. We can't just
drop everything and set off
96
on a salvage mission! SIT!
He turns his attention back to the becalmed water.
Ishmael glances helplessly at Bulkington. Queequeg
hauls in the lines as fast as he can.
The struck whale surfaces...missing the boat by a
few feet. It spins slowly in the water, its massive
jaws opening and closing with dwindling energy.
Queequeg and two oarsmen pull together on the slack
lines until they're taut with the harpoons imbedded
in the whale. They tow the boat toward the dying
creature.
As they pull up alongside it, Ahab's boat appears.
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
Ahab guides his craft behind Starbuck's boat. He
scans the whale with a grave look. Subdued now,
but storming inside. In a quiet voice:
AHAB
Did ye not see HIM, Mister
Starbuck?
STARBUCK
I did, sir.
Ahab turns a fierce expression on him, but his voice
remains low.
AHAB
And why did ye strike THIS
whale, if ye could see Moby
Dick?
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
Starbuck is silent for a beat.
STARBUCK
I'm a whaler, sir.
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
Long, silent eye contact. Ahab abruptly turns away
97
and waves at his Arab oarsmen. His boat pulls away
from Starbuck's. Ahab calls back over his shoulder:
AHAB
Get that blubber on deck
tonight, Starbuck, before
daylight. We'll be pushin'
on in the morning.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
Starbuck glances at Ishmael. He quickly shouts to
Ahab's retreating boat.
STARBUCK
What about the boy, sir?!
EXT. AHAB'S BOAT - DUSK
Ahab signals his oarsmen, and the boat slows.
In b.g., Stubb's and Flask's boats row in close to
join them, the whalers assessing the new kill.
Ahab turns, his face in shadow like a phantom in
the still gloom.
AHAB
What boy?
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DUSK
STARBUCK
Pip, sir. He's lost at sea.
Stubb's boat steers side by side with Starbuck's.
STUBB
Aye, I saw him myself! Miles
of sea between him and us by
now. We can't afford to lose
this fine kill on account of
that minstrel's foolishness.
AHAB
Pip, ye say? The tambourine
boy? And how did HE come
to be in your boat, Mister
Starbuck?
98
STARBUCK
Stowed away, sir, where he
wasn't supposed to be. He's
just a shipkeeper, Captain,
a tender-hearted jolly boy...
and I fear we've lost 'im.
Ishmael waits expectantly, full of worry. Queequeg
too looks concerned and steps forward.
QUEEQUEG
Me go find Pip! Pip be dead,
dat be bad magic!
Across the water, Ahab deliberates for a beat. He
grunts to his Arabs, and they continue to row. His
boat drifts away, as he calls back:
AHAB
Ye have 'til dawn to find
that ungracious little brat,
or whatever the sharks've
left of him, so make haste.
(to his oarsmen)
Give way now, greyhounds!
Dog to it!
Ishmael breathes a sigh of relief. So does Starbuck,
as he turns to Bulkington.
STARBUCK
Organize a search party,
Mister Bulkington. And take
Queequeg and Ishmael.
BULKINGTON
Aye, sir.
In b.g., Flask leans over from his boat and grins at
Queequeg, gesturing at the dead whale.
FLASK
Seems a shame to leave behind
such a noble prize.
Queequeg grunts scoffingly and turns away to the
bow, more interested in the rescue than the whale.
EXT. STUBB'S BOAT - DUSK
99
Starbuck jumps across from his boat into Stubb's.
STARBUCK
Let's bring this fish in,
Mister Stubb.
Stubb glances at Starbuck's boat, Bulkington now in
command. Stubb shakes his head.
STUBB
Ye got a hundred barrels of
sperm oil here -- why would ye
be wastin' yer men's time
lookin' for a cabin boy?
STARBUCK
It's the rightful thing to do.
A child's life is worth more
than a whale's hide.
STUBB
Aye, can't argue with that.
EXT. BULKINGTON'S BOAT - DUSK
Waving the men to their oars, Bulkington gazes out
into the darkness.
BULKINGTON
Let's to it, boys!
The oarsmen row. Ishmael wields his oar vigorously,
redoubling his efforts.
Receding away in Stubb's boat, Starbuck shouts back:
STARBUCK
I'll bust open a hogshead of
brandy to the man who finds
the boy! Will ye spit fire,
men?!
AYE, AYES all around. They row away from the other
boats, Queequeg perched at the bow, scanning the
sea like a hawk.
FADE OUT.
100
ACT 2
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - AFT DECK - NIGHT
A polished harpoon, sharpened on a spinning grindstone,
sparks flying. The sparks fill our view, behind them
Ahab's hard-set features. Waiting intensely.
The Blacksmith raises the harpoon, presenting its
two-flued razor head before the Captain. Ahab nods
with approval.
Glimpsed in b.g, a gigantic, severed whale's head
is hoisted and swung suspended over the deck by
pulley chains straining from yard arms. The deck
tilts to one side under its heavy weight.
Tri-works furnaces burn and boiling pots smoke,
adding a nightmarish atmosphere to the scene.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - NIGHT
Deep in the heart of moonlit darkness drifts a
lone, lamp-lit whale boat.
EXT. BULKINGTON'S BOAT - NIGHT
Glimmering lanterns held high, Bulkington, Ishmael
and the men search the calm sea. Queequeg peers
intently across the black, ominous waters. Not a
sign of life. The men call out sporadically:
CREWMEN
Pip! Pip! Where are ye, boy?!
INT. STARBUCK'S CABIN - NIGHT
Starbuck dozes over an open bible on his bunk,
a flickering candle beside him. The room tilts,
timbers GROANING and CREAKING.
The candle burns down...a TIME-LAPSE EFFECT, as
hours pass in seconds...to a melted, dead stump
by the light of dawn.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAWN
Dawn's early light creeps over an endless horizon.
101
Pip clings helplessly to the lifebuoy, alone in the
vast emptiness. He sings a little DITTY in a
trembling voice.
His head jerks around with a moan of despair...
A shark's fin streaks through the water with lethal
swiftness, circling around him.
Pip bobs frantically, gasping with terror, wide eyes
fixed on the approaching predator.
The shark fin disappears under. Instinctively, Pip dives...
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAWN
Holding his breath, Pip sees the shark closing in with
smaller circles, fixed on him with cold, unblinking black
eyes. Pip waves his arms and legs furiously in a vain
effort to scare off the death mask before him. The
circling shark moves in for the kill, its jaws widening...
Pip manages to land a fist directly onto the shark's nose!
It flips its tail, darts away...then streaks in again, relentlessly
closer...
A massive white wall suddenly fills the deep -- passing
within inches of Pip! The shark flees. Pip surfaces...
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAWN
Pip sucks in air, clutching the lifebuoy. His wide eyes
on the titantic white whale, plunging away, leaving swells
in his wake. MOBY DICK is gone as quickly as he appears.
An empty sea again, the waves too high for Pip to see far. Then...
Another, bigger shark's fin approaches. Again circling
him, again submerging...
Pip takes deep gulps of air, then dives again.
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAWN
Pip gapes. A great white shark, three times larger.
It circles once, then zeros in. Resigned to death,
Pip shuts his eyes and exhales bubbles of air...
sinking. The big shark draws closer, closer...
A sharp WHISSHHH -- a harpoon spears through the
shark's body! Thrashing in a cloud of blood, the
102
great white vanishes from sight.
Eyes closed, losing consciousness, Pip sinks down...
A tattooed arm dips down from above -- a hand seizes
Pip by the hair and hauls him up toward the light.
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - MORNING
Ahab stands by the cabin window, staring morosely at
the rising sun.
The Carpenter kneels at his feet, working to fit a new
whale-bone peg leg, having a difficult time setting it
in its place.
CARPENTER
If the Capt'n pleases...let
me measure it now, sir.
Ahab glares down at his poorly fitted stump, his
irritation more of a good-humored bark than bite.
AHAB
Are you a manmaker, Carpenter,
that you'd measure me like a
suit?! Well, carry on...it's
not the first time.
The Carpenter secures the peg leg with a tightening tool.
AHAB (cont')
Accursed fate, that my soul
would have such a craven
mate for a body.
CARPENTER
How does that feel, sir?
AHAB
I canst say. I only feel
what is not there.
CARPENTER
Aye. A dismasted man never
loses the feeling of his
lost spar.
103
AHAB
Ah, that's better...good!
He bends down and grasps the bone stump with both hands,
then grabs the Carpenter's tool to tighten it harder.
CARPENTER
Oh sir, careful, sir! It'll
break bones, that will...
AHAB
(laughs bitterly)
No fear! I like a good grip!
I like to feel something in
this slippery world that I
can hold onto!
Ahab straightens up and gazes inwardly.
AHAB (cont'd)
You ever hear of an old Greek
named Prometheus?
CARPENTER
No, sir...can't say I ever
shipped with the man, sir.
AHAB
Prometheus was he who made
men. Made 'em whole with tools,
like this...
(indicates tool)
Then he animated them from
FIRE! 'Twas he who should have
made me...what's made in fire
must properly belongs to fire.
The Carpenter finishes and looks up, clearly mystified
by him. Ahab looks inspired, spilling out the words:
AHAB (cont'd)
Then I would've been complete!
Fifty feet high in my socks!
My legs would have ROOTS, my
arms three feet to the wrist!
No heart at all...eyes? No!
A skylight atop my head to
light up an acre of brains.
Proud as a Greek god...AYE!
A Greek god...
104
(looks down)
And not standing on a broken
stick of dead bone.
He gazes wretchedly at his stump, back to reality.
AHAB (cont'd)
Aye...my torn soul and gashed
body...they bleed into each
other.
(to himself)
Aye. The truth shakes me
falsely.
In b.g. by the cabin doorway, a turbaned figure
lingers in the shadows. Fedallah.
The Carpenter rises stiffly, bent with arthritis.
AHAB (cont'd)
I thank ye, Carpenter. Now,
go back to your fixin's...
leave Ahab to the gods.
CARPENTER
Aye, aye, sir.
He shuffles out. Ahab sits deep in his broodings,
then recognizes the shadowy presence. A gruff,
impatient tone:
AHAB
What d'ye want?
Fedallah eases into the lamp light, an inscrutable
smile of broken teeth. His English is thickly
accented, his voice gnarled and sibilant:
FEDALLAH
The dream comes to me again...
of my master's death.
Ahab doesn't move or react.
AHAB
MY death? Then I pray ye go
before me.
Fedallah shrugs, as if the thought were supremely
indifferent to him.
105
FEDALLAH
I shall. As your pilot.
AHAB
Well then, me pilot, I pledge
to ye that I will slay Moby
Dick -- and survive it!
Fedallah's voice lowers, full of dark meaning:
FEDALLAH
Only rope can destroy Ahab.
AHAB
(laughs)
The gallows, then? Ha! Well
then...I am immortal!
Fedallah slinks back into the shadows, saying no
more. Ahab glares scornfully after him...yet
unnerved by him.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
The suspended whale's head, stripped of blubber,
is hoisted overboard from the lower mast cranes.
Almost a skeleton, it's a ghastly sight.
Starbuck oversees crewmen gathered around the port
side, working the chains and pulleys and about to
drop it into the sea. A SHOUT from the lookout:
DAGOO (O.S.)
Whaleboat to starboard helm!
They got PIP!
Starbuck and the men rush in unison to the starboard
side. WILD CHEERS ring out, as Bulkington's boat
rows in fast.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - MORNING
Ahab emerges from his cabin and looks down to see
the rescue party climbing aboard. Surprised by the
sight of Pip, his harsh face softens, almost a smile.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
106
Queequeg boards with little Pip in his arms, the boy
dazed but alive. Bulkington takes him and hands him
to Flask, who gives him to Stubb. The men pass the
boy between them like a bucket brigade...to Starbuck,
who sits Pip atop an oil barrel.
STARBUCK
We missed ye, lad! Bring 'im
his music!
Pip stares vacantly, disoriented. Stubb turns to
Bulkington with a laugh.
STUBB
Well, this is a fine day!
We'd given him up for lost!
BULKINGTON
Thank Ishmael and Queequeg.
They spotted him.
Stubb turns to pound Ishmael's back with a mighty
whack.
STUBB
By jimminy! You're a credit
to us all!
Ishmael smiles proudly, as men give him and Queequeg
hearty pats. The two trade grins of brotherly
kinship. They step over to Pip.
Everyone gathers round the boy, as Tashtego pushes
the tambourine into Pip's hands.
TASHTEGO
G'won, Pip! Do us a tune!
Pip focuses glassy eyes on the tambourine, as if he
doesn't recognize it. Then...he throws it violently
to the deck. Stunned, silent looks all around.
Queequeg picks it up with a disturbed frown. Ishmael
reaches out to Pip.
ISHMAEL
Pip...what is it, boy?
Pip scans the men's face, as if they were strangers.
Ishmael lays a gentle hand on him -- Pip thrashes
107
out, delirious, pummeling him with his small fists.
Then he leaps off the barrel and dashes away. The
men watch, horrified.
Pip scurries aimlessly around the deck in a wild
panic, slips and falls. Around him, the planks are
slick with whale blood and bones. Pip stares at
the blood on his hands, then gapes up toward:
The giant, skeletal whale head, hanging over the
side above him. Pip gives an ear-shattering SHRIEK!
Bewildered, the men don't know what to do. Queequeg
rushes over and quickly releases a pulley chain...
The whale head plummets into the sea, a huge SPLASH!
Pip staggers up and runs to a whaleboat, flailing
his arms as he did underwater with the sharks. He
climbs into it, as if out of the sea. Crouches
inside of it, huddled and BABBLING to himself.
Completely insane.
The crew stares at him with befuddled looks, their
morale shattered. Queequeg turns grimly to Ishmael.
QUEEQUEG
Dis bad magic. BAD magic.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Witnessing the scene below, Ahab too is affected.
But his mind turns elsewhere, as he shouts down:
AHAB
Prepare to set sail, Starbuck!
We've wasted enough time!
STARBUCK
Right away, sir. Up sails,
mates, let's catch a breeze!
Men disperse to their duties, too demoralized to jump
to it, slowly climbing the masts. Ahab booms at them:
AHAB
Make speed, ye lackies! Do
ye not know he's out there?!
Thunder away at it! We'll not
be whalers again -- 'til it's
108
MOBY DICK'S head hangin' from
these yard arms!
Driven by his voice, the crew picks up the pace.
EXT. SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
Clear skies to the horizon. The full-sailed Pequod
speeds across deeper, bluer waters. Her bow dips
and plows through powerful swells.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MASTS - DAY
All sails billow out like canvas balloons, masts
swaying in a strong breeze. A breathtaking view.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
By the helm, Starbuck squints toward the horizon
and checks his compass. He turns to the wheelman.
STARBUCK
Two points east southeast.
Steady before the breeze.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Starbuck steps down to middeck before a curious sight
at the bottom of the main mast:
Ahab stands on the flat seat of a custom-made cradle
suspended a few feet off the deck. Stubb and Flask
rig pulley lines beside him. Starbuck approaches
Ahab.
STARBUCK
If the wind holds up, sir,
we should be around the Cape
in two days hence.
AHAB
Aye, but no later than that.
(indicates cradle)
Now I too will stand lookout.
Is it ready, Mister Stubb?
STUBB
Secure as a mother's arms, sir.
109
AHAB
Starbuck, take the rope and
raise your captain. I will
commend my life into thy hands.
Looks between them, as if this were a test of loyalty.
Starbuck steps forward, takes the pulley line, then
hauls Ahab's cradle up the mast with strong hands.
AHAB (cont'd)
I'll have first sight of the
white whale. Aye, myself!
As he ascends, he slams a fist against the gold coin.
AHAB (cont'd)
And win back my doubloon!
The cradle rises to the maintop, swinging in the
breeze. Ahab stands like an iron statue, keeping
perfect balance, fiery eyes fixed to the horizon.
All the crew watch his upward progress. Fedallah
smiles to himself with feline cunning. Watching from
their station, Ishmael and Queequeg turn toward Pip:
Still in the whaleboat, Pip MUTTERS incomprehensibly
to himself in some strange, mindless language. Never
again will he smile or dance.
EXT. SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
The Pequod plunges up and down through rolling swells,
waves crashing against her bow.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MAINTOP - DAY
Ahab's high cradle swings like a pendulum. He keeps
a determined watch, rigid on his peg leg.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
The crew swabs the deck clean. None of them notice
Pip, who scrambles out of the whaleboat and makes a
beeline for the main mast.
He stares dourly at the shiny gold coin nailed to the
wood. A whispery singsong voice:
PIP
110
We, ye, they...are all bats!
Ishmael and the others turn, watching perplexedly.
Pip points to the Captain's cabin.
PIP (cont'd)
There! In there! Two bones
stuck in trousers...and one
be not his, but a whale's!
Stubb steps over to observe him, chuckling nervously.
STUBB
I fear we should've left
Pip to his fate, poor boy!
Pip recoils from Stubb and darts up the mast ropes
like a little monkey.
EXT. MAIN MAST - DAY
He perches halfway on the ladder, GIBBERING AWAY in
mad terror. Higher above him, Ahab nods off from
weariness.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Stubb shakes his head up at him. He turns to peer
closely at the doubloon. Starbuck, Flask and
Ishmael join him.
STUBB
Sixteen dollars. HAH! I've
seen doubloons before, nothin'
but round things made of gold.
Not much wonder in 'em. But
whoever kills that white
demon, this round thing
belongs to him!
FLASK
It's ship's bounty to ME,
Stubb -- it'll win me nine
hundred and sixty cigars!
In b.g., Fedallah chortles mischievously at them with
a toothy grin and shakes his head.
111
STARBUCK
It's the ship's navel, I tell
ye. And everyone's on fire
to unscrew it. But unscrew
a navel and see what happens.
Stubb and Flask look at him, uncomprehending. Ishmael
nods understandingly.
ISHMAEL
Aye. To me it speaks wisely...
but sadly. It's all in one's
perception.
STARBUCK
Perception? How d'ye mean?
ISHMAEL
Different ways of lookin',
sir. I used to teach my
school children about...what
Man sees and what God sees.
But Man sees only one thing,
what he WANTS to see.
EXT. MAINTOP - DAY
Exhausted, Ahab dozes as he stands on his lookout
cradle. Above him on the top lookout, Tashtego
scans the horizon and suddenly cries out:
TASHTEGO
There she blows, Cap'n!! It's
WHITE! The white whale!
Startled, Ahab pops his eyes open and peers out.
EXT. SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
Far to the horizon, a distant spout amidst rolling
whitecaps. A whale, but too far away to distinguish.
EXT. MAINTOP - DAY
Ahab's face twists into a glower of such hatred that
he's momentarily incapable of speaking. Then...
AHAB
Lower me away! Quick, there!
112
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Deckhands rush to man the pulley ropes, while others
hasten to the bulwarks to sight the whale.
Starbuck and Ishmael gaze up at Ahab, tiring of all
this madness.
ISHMAEL
'Tis like the old man and
his whale. He sees but a
monster of destruction...
(turns to Starbuck)
Perhaps in God's eyes, Moby
Dick is just another of His
creatures, doin' what's
natural...
Absorbing this, Starbuck looks between lowering Ahab
and the mast coin beside him. Its brilliant gold
reflection catches his eye...blinding him.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Just that. Just a whale.
Starbuck shields his eyes and turns away.
STARBUCK
Damnable coin! It's put here
to blind us all!
Ahab lands on the deck before them. He quickly
THUNK-CLOPS to the bulwark with feverish energy.
AHAB
Steward! My eyeglass!
Starbuck leans calmly over the side amidst excited
sailors, gazing out with an eagle's eye.
STARBUCK
It's not white, Captain, it's
grey. Probably a humpback.
Ahab snatches his eyeglass from the Steward and peers
out. He can't see well enough and angrily tosses it.
AHAB
It's Moby Dick, I tell ye!
(shouts up)
Unfurl the topgallants -- we
113
need more sail!
Starbuck catches sight of something else and points
seaward.
STARBUCK
Lo, sir! Sperm whales, to
the starboard beam!
EXT. SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
A small pod of spouting sperm heads, a half-mile across
the water. A healthy harvest.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Ahab keeps his eyes glued to the bow, refusing to even
glance starboard. Starbuck turns to him.
STARBUCK
Shall we lower away, sir?
AHAB
Up all sails, Mister Starbuck!
Drive on!
STARBUCK
There's barrels of gold out
there, sir -- worth far more
than a Spanish coin!
AHAB
Those are my orders!
STARBUCK
But SIR!--
AHAB
SAIL ON, I SAY!
A tense beat, Starbuck rebellious. But he does nothing.
He turns to see Fedallah smiling slyly at him, picking
his teeth with his long fingernail. Starbuck shouts to
the wheel.
STARBUCK
Steady on course, helmsman!
Sail onward...
(to himself)
114
Nowhere.
EXT. TOPMASTS - DAY
High on the tallest mast, hands unfurl the topgallant
sails. One after another, until every sheet is taut
with wind.
EXT. SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
All sails full, the Pequod drives hard to leeward in
pursuit of the elusive spout...a speck on the sea.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Stubb and Bulkington lean over the side, harsh spray
in their faces, watching seaward:
EXT. SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
The distant, unrecognizable whale dives out of sight.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Ahab ROARS, frustrated again. He paces across the
ship at that half-stomping gait, stewing away.
Stubb turns out of the wind and lights his pipe.
STUBB
Well, that's that. He'll
not breach for an hour, and
miles from here. He's a
cunning one, that Moby Dick.
BULKINGTON
If it WAS Moby Dick...
He looks off toward pacing Ahab, with deep knowledge:
BULKINGTON (cont'd)
But he'll make us chase him
across the Antarctic, if we
let 'im. And when we're good
and exhausted, when it's time
to turn back, Ahab'll say
"Drive on!"
(turns to Stubb)
He's seen Moby Dick...he's
115
looked again into that cold
eye. He won't let up now.
Ahab stops at the port side to look out, desperate for
a sign. Fedallah edges close beside him. He hisses
aside to him in deepest privacy, nodding toward sea.
FEDALLAH
He IS out there, my master.
Very near now...very near!
EXT. SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY
The Pequod speeds southward through colder waters,
her sails straining against the wind. On the horizon,
drifting ice floes speckle the grey sea.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
The tri-works furnace burns, billowing black smoke.
The Cook pulls out a baked loaf of bread on the blade
end of a harpoon. The Blacksmith dumps in a bucket
of whale oil to fuel the tri-works' blaze.
Bundled in winter coats and scarves, Stubb, Flask and
others huddle close to the warmth of its open hearth.
Ishmael paces nearby to ward off the cold.
Starbuck steps over to watch the Blacksmith dip his
bucket into an open oil cask.
STARBUCK
Burning the cargo, are we now?
Wasting our profits?
FLASK
What good is our damned profits
if we freeze to death?!
Starbuck nods resignedly and kneels down to warm
himself beside Bulkington and Pip. The men glance
sullenly toward their lone captain on the bow.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Ahab stands fixed on the bow in his thin black coat,
inured to the subzero chill, eyes riveted to the
horizon as if trying to will the whale to appear.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
116
Ishmael paces beside the bulwark and gazes down at
the water:
EXT. SHIP'S SIDE - DAY
Small chunks of ice float past in the currents.
EXT. SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY
An antarctic desolation of sea and ice. The Pequod's
course is slowed by massive bergs and broken floes the
size of islands. Beyond lie endless fields of ice.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Halyard ropes are frozen, riddled with icicles. Crewmen
move stiffly about, slipping on the sleet-covered deck.
Ishmael and Queequeg gape out in wonder at the high
peaks of passing bergs.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Ahab stares wearily forward, his face frostbitten,
his energy sapped by the cold. Starbuck approaches him,
hugging his coat, chilled to the bone. Weary irony
in his voice:
STARBUCK
Captain. Might I be so bold
to suggest that we turn north
now. Back on course, sir,
toward the Cape.
Ahab offers no reply, eyes fixed forward.
STARBUCK
There are no whales in these
waters, sir.
AHAB
He's there, Mister Starbuck.
He dares me to follow.
He peers over the masses of ice with forced confidence.
AHAB
I've sailed over Greenland
waters worst than this. We can
force through this ice.
117
STARBUCK
Aye, but not THIS time of year.
The ice is too thick for such
a gamble -- it can break this
ship up into matchwood!
AHAB
We will drive on.
STARBUCK
But Moby Dick's trackings are
due EAST, sir -- you told me
yourself! Around the Cape!
Ahab's will almost weakens, but he won't give in.
AHAB
He's taunting us, man, don't ye
see that? He's taunting us!
EXT. SHIP'S SIDE - DAY
Huge ice chunks collide against the bow hull.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Starbuck and Stubb stare over the side with worrisome
frowns.
STARBUCK
Pack ice.
STUBB
Aye, a bad sign. Shouldn't we
turn about?
STARBUCK
(a bitter smirk)
Captain's orders.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
At the helm, shivering Dough-Boy steers through the
obstacle course of icebergs. He glances anxiously at
his captain at the railing.
Ahab gazes across the expanse, a lifeless figure, his
eyes fixed on the frozen wasteland.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
118
Starbuck and Stubb stare grimly forward: dead ahead,
the passage between ice floes narrows into a twisty
water lane through solid sheets of whiteness.
EXT. SHIP'S SIDE - DAY
An ice floe's edge SCRAPES dangerously against the hull.
INT. FORECASTLE - DAY
Hull timbers CREAK under a terrible pressure. Frozen
faces listen to the SCRAPING SOUNDS outside, Ishmael
and Queequeg crouched together in thick blankets.
ISHMAEL
That old man's going to kill
us all!
QUEEQUEG
He de devil.
The Carpenter and the Cook look over from their bunks.
CARPENTER
I wouldn't judge 'im too harshly.
How'd ye feel if YOU had a stick
of whalebone for a bedfellow?
The Cook glances over the old, bent man with a scoff.
COOK
Wouldn't do YOU much good, now
would it?
The Carpenter glares back at him.
EXT. SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY
A forward view of the Pequod: the sharp points of two
giant ice floes close in rapidly, blocking her path!
Men run to the bow bulwarks in alarm.
A rear view of her stern: massive chunks of pack ice
drift in behind, the ship now trapped from both sides!
INT. FORECASTLE - DAY
The cabin shakes from a terrible CRUNCH of ice! Ishmael
119
cowers in fear. Everyone bolts up and dashes deckside.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Dismayed by the impact, Ahab shouts to his helmsman.
AHAB
Hard to port!
Dough-Boy spins the wheel hard. The deck shudders
violently -- the SOUNDS of GNASHING, GRINDING ICE!
EXT. SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY
The Pequod slows to an agonizing halt -- wedged into
the joined points of the ice floes! Ice edges grip
her bow hull like a slowly closing vise.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Starbuck and Stubb rush to the side and look down.
Ahab THUNK-CLOPS furiously forward and stares out in
despair, crewmen behind him.
AHAB
Crack my heart, I've lost him!
STARBUCK
Lost HIM?! Dammit, we're
losing our SHIP!
He leaps down to middeck, shouting orders.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Quick, men, lower the sheets!
Dump the anchors! Carpenter,
fetch timber! You harpooners,
come below deck!
INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - DAY
Starbuck and others clamor downstairs. Walls around
them GROAN from the weight of wedged ice.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Ahab stands fast at the frozen bow, oblivious to the
commotion, staring at the white vastness around him.
AHAB
120
Oh my insufferable foe...thy
whiteness blinds me! My feud
is undone...
He shuts his eyes from the white expanse.
INT. BOW HOLD - DAY
A bulkhead GROANS and CREAKS from the crushing pressure
outside. Starbuck, Bulkington and the harpooners lift a
heavy mast timber to shore up the bow walls, its length
spanning the full width of the hold. The old Carpenter
carries in another huge timber on his back, crouched
over like Christ bearing the cross.
EXT. SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY
The Pequod sits silent and immobile between the floes,
marooned in a prairie of ice. Just beyond the wedge
lies a gap of open sea. So close, so unreachable.
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY
Ahab moves to an open window and gazes out defeatedly at
the frozen expanse outside, an icy breeze in his face.
Tears well up in his eyes. Then, an angry outcry...
AHAB
Why must I endure these
torments?! If I had but ONE
MOMENT, flank to flank with
that demon whale, I'd face a
thousand-fold perils!
(clenches a fist)
Damn yer white hide, where
ARE ye?! Show yourself!
Show me a sign!
He listens to the antarctic silence. No sound but the
WHISTLING WIND against his face.
He turns and slumps down in a chair before his table of cluttered
maps, staring futilely at them.
AHAB
So be it...
He sweeps them off the table in a fury. Then realizes
with a sudden inward horror:
121
AHAB (cont'd)
Plague my soul...I AM Jonah
now! The God-fugitive!
He buries his face in his hands. Sobs uncontrollably.
The cabin door creeps open...the shadowy figure of
Fedallah towers before him. In b.g., a commotion of
men running through the corridor.
Ahab looks up, as Fedallah takes a musket hanging from
a wall and slowly approaches with an inscrutable smile.
Ahab hardens, noting the weapon with irony.
AHAB
What prophecy is this, then?
A mutiny or a speedy death?
Fedallah's silent smile broadens to a grin.
AHAB
That bad, aye? What savagery
have I wrought...so consumed
with the hot fire of my purpose
that I've murdered my own men!
Fedallah draws very close and removes a pouch hanging
from the musket. He opens Ahab's palm and trickles a
handful of black powder into it. Gunpowder.
FEDALLAH
All is not lost, my master.
Ahab puzzles over the powder in his hand. Then, a
knowing smile spreads across his face.
INT. BOW HOLD - DAY
Starbuck, Bulkington and the harpooners brace the ends
of a timber under their shoulders, pushing and grunting
with herculean strength, leaking water streaming over
them.
STARBUCK
Push, damn ye! Harder!!
A new leak gushes into Dagoo's face. He lets go in panic.
DAGOO
Ain't no good! We all gonna
122
drown!! I ain't gon' die...
He turns to escape the hold -- Bulkington seizes him and
wields a huge Bowie knife against his throat.
BULKINGTON
Get back here, ye black bastard!
Dagoo struggles against him, grappling his knife hand.
DAGOO
Leggo o' me, white dog!
Locked together, might against might...the Bowie knife
poised between them. The stronger of the two, Dagoo
slowly turns the blade toward Bulkington's throat.
A SHOT RINGS OUT -- a bullet splinters the bulkhead,
inches from their face! The two freeze.
Ahab looms from the corridor behind them, the smoking
musket in hand.
AHAB
Is it a fight ye want, lads?!
Then the fight is out there!
INT. CARGO HOLD
A key turns in a door lock -- the door swings open to
reveal barrels of gunpowder. Hands quickly grab them.
EXT. SOUTHERN OCEAN - ICE FLOES - DAY
A burning fuse inches toward powder barrels dug into
the fissure between the ice floes...KABLOOM! A quick
fireball! Ice chunks rain down! The smoke clears to
reveal a narrow gap...just wide enough for the Pequod
to pass through.
EXT. BOW DECK
The crew BELLOWS OUT A MASS CHEER! Ahab storms through
their midst, addressing all with tornado brows.
AHAB
MOBY DICK, my hearties! Have
ye too soon forgotten?! Then
123
let me raise the ante...
He turns and gestures to the gold coin on the mast.
AHAB
Upon the day that white whale
be killed, THIRTY times this
sum shall be divided among ye!
A piece o' gold for EACH AND
EVERY one of ye! Now what
d'ye say to that?!
Starbuck and the crew stare at him, dumbfounded.
AHAB
I do not order ye! Ye shall
WILL IT SO! If Moby Dick
will not come to us -- then
we will come to him! DEATH
to Moby Dick!
The crew echoes him passionately, shouting as one:
CREWMEN
MOBY DICK!!
EXT. ICE FLOES - DAY
Crewmen are fanned out on each side of the narrow
waterway -- towing the ship by ropes fastened to her
bow. They pull on lines attached to canvas belts
around their waists, struggling on foot across the
white ice with all their strength and their hearts,
SINGING in rhythm to every straining tug.
CREWMEN
Ho! The fair wind!
Ho-he-ho! Cheerily, men!
Everyone pulls with dogged passion. Slaves to their
captain's will. In b.g., the tall-masted Pequod
inches ponderously along.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Ahab watches the approach of the widening gap onto the
open sea, Starbuck behind him. Ahab towers tall in the
frozen gloom, proud as Lucifer, victorious. He gazes
yonder.
124
AHAB
The masterless, untamed sea,
Mister Starbuck. Behold its
tranquil skin...but beneath
it pants a tiger heart. This
velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang. But we'll
not yield to it, shall we?
Starbuck gazes hard at Ahab's back.
STARBUCK
No, Captain. I shall not
yield to it.
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY
Deserted, quiet. The door creeps open. Pip ventures
in, HUMMING some mad melody. Wandering through Ahab's
forbidden domain, he comes upon a large carved box and
opens it: scrimshaw chess pieces, an ivory chess board.
Pip runs his hands over exquisitely carved whale pieces.
He spills the contents onto the floor. Kneeling down,
he carefully selects the black king and places it on the
board. Looks around the cabin, searching for something.
He jumps up and snatches up a whale-tooth paperweight.
Pip plops back on the floor and places the tooth on the
board...the white whale...directly in front of the black
king. He leans back and seriously studies the board,
HUMMING AWAY. Then jumps up and browses around...
Two spare whale-bone peg legs protrude from an open
sea chest. Pip touches them with a strange reverence.
An arctic breeze wafts in from the window and knocks
Ahab's top hat off a clothes rack full of black coats.
The hat rolls along the floor...stopping before Pip.
EXT. ICE FLOES - DAY
The Pequod passes through onto open waters. Men on the
floes drop their ropes and give her a ROUSING CHEER!
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
125
Ahab nods triumphantly at them, aside to Starbuck:
AHAB
We may master this ocean yet!
EXT. SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY
The freed Pequod hugs the wind, forging at full knots.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - DAY
Sailors tumble aloft to man the sails. Starbuck takes
over the helm. Stubb mans the rigging with Ishmael and
Queequeg. Ahab hurries toward his cabin, shouting
orders all around.
AHAB
Look to the binnacle! Square
the yards up there!
He stops dead in his tracks, staring forward. The
others stare in his direction, their eyes widening.
Framed in the cabin doorway is a tall figure in a
black coat and top hat, standing on two white peg legs.
It's Pip -- dressed in Ahab's clothes, weaving with
precarious balance on whale-bone stilts!
Ahab stares at Pip's disguise. Clearly amused.
AHAB
By God, it's my reflection...
in everything but the eyes!
Who are ye, mister?
PIP
Bell-boy, sir! Ship's crier!
Ding dong ding! Pip! Sir!
Stubb steps forward to reach out and grab the boy.
STUBB
Quiet, ye crazy loon! Away
from the Captain's quarters--
AHAB
(stops him)
Shhh! Hands off His Holiness!
126
The greater idiot ever scolds
the lesser!
He takes Pip in hand. Truly smiles for the first
time.
AHAB (cont'd)
Oh, frozen heavens, look down
upon this luckless child!
Here, come with me, Pip...
He ushers him back into his cabin, Pip wobbling along.
AHAB (cont'd)
My cabin shall be your home
from now on -- for as long as
Ahab lives. You're tied to me
with cords of heartstrings, my
lad, you've touched my center!
Come along, Pip...
He ushers him gently inside. Starbuck trades confused
looks with Stubb -- who bursts out laughing.
STUBB
Blood and thunder! Well,
there go two crazy ones now!
One crazy with strength, the
other crazy with weakness!
A "greater idiot," am I,
eh? Than Pip?! HA!
Ishmael and Queequeg exchange bewildered looks.
FADE OUT.
ACT 4
EXT. CAPE HOPE SEAS - DAY
The Pequod plunges through heavier seas. A gusty,
sunlit day, but the waters here are forever stormy.
Approaching in b.g., tall sails. A whaling ship.
LOOKOUT (O.S.)
Sail ho!
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - BOW DECK - DAY
127
Wind blistering his face at the bow, Ahab searches
the horizon with piercing curiosity.
AHAB
Where away?!
LOOKOUT (O.S.)
Three points on the larboard
bow, sir! She's bringin'
down her breeze to us!
Ahab turns forward to port and sees her:
EXT. CAPE HORN SEAS - DAY
The Rachel, a veteran ship like the Pequod, making
for us under full sail.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Starbuck and Stubb peer out from the port bulwarks,
expectancy on their faces.
STUBB
Well, now! That's a cheerin'
sight!
Bulkington stares out, an intense look on his face,
as if the nearing ship were a means of escape.
EXT. CAPE HORN SEAS - DAY
An airborne view: the Rachel is almost abreast of the
Pequod, maneuvering to cut the wind from her sails.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
The crew watches from the port rails, the Rachel in
full view as the two ships heave side by side on the
rough seas.
The Rachel's sailors SHOUT GREETINGS, but our crew
just stares back. Frozen in place, waiting for Ahab.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Ahab balances himself atop the bow gunwale and stands
128
tall above his crew, looking down on the Rachel's
deck. Starbuck approaches, Stubb and Ishmael in tow.
STARBUCK
Shall we reef the sails for
boarding, sir?
AHAB
No time, Mister Starbuck.
Starbuck gives him a look, expecting that.
Across the patch of rolling waters, the CAPTAIN of
the Rachel yells through a megaphone:
RACHEL CAPTAIN
Have ye seen a whale boat
adrift, Captain?!
Ahab's face tightens, taken back by that. He clings
to a stay, cups his hand to his mouth and shouts:
AHAB
Have ye seen the White Whale?!
RACHEL CAPTAIN
(distractedly)
Aye, we have...this morning...
Ahab reacts with renewed excitement, beside himself.
AHAB
Where was he, Captain?! Not
dead, was he? Not...killed!?
RACHEL CAPTAIN
What does that matter?!
As beside himself as Ahab, the Captain shouts out
with misery in his voice:
RACHEL CAPTAIN (cont'd)
My boy, sir! I lost a whale
boat -- my own SON is on that
boat! For God's sake, I beg
of ye...help me find 'im!
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Ahab's crew react, eyes turned on their Captain.
129
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Ahab shakes his head, a desperate man.
AHAB
Don't! No, don't ask me to,
Captain...
The Rachel's Captain shouts louder, just as desperate.
RACHEL CAPTAIN
I know you, Ahab -- we have
shipped together! Let me
charter your ship, sir, just
for one day! I will gladly
pay for it and pay handsomely!
You must...you must and you
shall do this for me, Ahab!
Starbuck, Stubb and Ishmael listen to his pleadings,
Stubb overwhelmed.
STUBB
By heavens, we must help the
man! To hell with Ahab and
his damned whale!
Starbuck reacts to Stubb's unusual display of emotion.
STARBUCK
The boy's drowned, Stubb.
You know it as well as I do.
ISHMAEL
Drowned? How d'ye know that,
Mister Starbuck?
He looks between him and Stubb, both nodding sadly.
Ahab, clearly pained by the Rachel Captain's loss,
fights off any show of feeling and stands stiffly.
AHAB
The whale, Captain! Where
was he when ye last clapped
eyes on him?!
RACHEL CAPTAIN
Captain Ahab! I will not go
130
'til I hear ye say AYE to me!
I know ye have a child of
your own, safe in Nantucket!
You know I'd do for you and
your son what I'm askin' ye
to do for mine! Yes, yes,
I can see that you relent!...
Ahab's face almost weakens, but he stands like an
anvil. The Rachel Captain shouts on determinedly:
RACHEL CAPTAIN (cont'd)
I see it! You're relenting,
Ahab!
(to his crew)
Run, men! Stand by to square
in the yards!
(across to Ahab)
We're all going to look for
that whale boat, sir, and
find my boy!
Ahab shakes his head, roaring into the wind:
AHAB
NAY! Touch not a rope-yarn!
Not a block nor a stay!
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Shocked reactions from all around him.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
AHAB (cont'd)
I will not do it, Captain
Gardiner! Even as we speak,
I am losing time and I'll
not lose any more!
(turns quickly)
Mister Starbuck! Prepare
to turn windward!
Stubb and Ishmael stare at him in utter disbelief.
Unsurprised, Starbuck just glares at him, refusing
to budge. Ignoring him, Ahab bellows at his crew:
AHAB (cont'd)
Man the yards, we're sailing
on! ON THE DOUBLE!
131
Fearful of his wrath, the deckhands rush to their
duties. Starbuck stands there fixed, hatred in
his eyes. Ahab shouts across the water:
AHAB (cont'd)
Goodbye, Captain Gardiner!
Goodbye and may God help ye,
man! May I forgive myself,
but now I MUST GO!
RACHEL CAPTAIN
(a voice of doom)
GOD will not forgive you for
this, Ahab! He will not
forgive you!!
Across the waters, the Rachel starts to recede,
as we steer off. The distant Captain stands fast,
his figure dwindling away.
Ishmael stares out at the sight, dread in his eyes.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Ahab sweeps across toward the quarterdeck...
AHAB
Helmsman! Steady on an
easterly course--
Queequeg suddenly blocks his way, harpoon in hand.
A tower of defiance.
QUEEQUEG
Queequeg sail no more!
AHAB
To your station, harpooner!
QUEEQUEG
Cap'n be BAD MAGIC!
AHAB
Obey me!--
Queequeg SLAMS his harpoon down -- its sharp point
into the deck between Ahab's feet! Ahab edges back.
132
QUEEQUEG
Queequeg harpoon NO MORE!
With that, he struts to the foot of the main mast,
plops down on the deck and sits erect and unmoving.
Gazing dead ahead. Rooted to the spot.
Ahab is near exploding. He thinks twice, glancing
around at the men. Faces stare at him. Deciding
to ignore Queequeg, he marches away to his cabin.
Starbuck, no longer able to contain himself, starts
after Ahab.
STARBUCK
Captain!
Ahab presses on, refusing to hear him.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Captain Ahab, sir!
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY
Ahab storms in, starts to shut the door -- Starbuck
blocks it open. Ahab reacts with angry surprise.
AHAB
Let go that door, Mister
Starbuck!
STARBUCK
Permission to speak with ye--
AHAB
Permission denied!
STARBUCK
I WILL speak, sir!
AHAB
Return to your duties, man!
On your toes--
Starbuck forces his way into the cabin. Ahab backs
away, outraged. Starbuck closes the door behind him.
In b.g., little Pip sits on Ahab's bunk, bundled up
in the Captain's robe, toying with chess pieces,
133
BABBLING to himself. Oblivious to them.
In sudden fury, Ahab seizes a musket hanging on a
wall. He points it at Starbuck, who stands defiant.
AHAB
Ye insubordinate bastard!
Back to deck -- or by God I'll
deliver ye straight into hell!
STARBUCK
I AM in hell, sir!
Ahab eases his grip, taken back by that. Starbuck
faces him with calm fortitude, a voice of reason:
STARBUCK
Capt'n, we've sailed thousands
of miles to stock oil. We're
breakin' a solemn oath chasing
this...mirage of a whale!
What will the OWNERS say if
we return with an empty hold?
AHAB
Owners?! What cares Ahab?!
Let those miserly OWNERS stand
on Nantucket beach and outyell
the typhoons, for all I care!
They're not my conscience --
MY conscience is in this
ship's keel!
(threatens musket)
Now get back on deck!
Starbuck stands fast, unconcerned by the pointed weapon.
STARBUCK
Your conscience, Capt'n, is
drawin' water. In the end
it'll sink ye down -- and
drag US down in your wake!
AHAB
Damnation! AGAIN you dare
to question me--
STARBUCK
134
In Jesus' name, think of your
MEN! No more of this madness!
The angels mob ye with warnings,
sir -- do ye not SEE them?!
Ahab cocks the musket threateningly, ready to use it.
AHAB
Out! Get back to the deck!
STARBUCK
Nay, sir, not yet!
(with forced calm)
I only ask that we try to
be reasonable men...
AHAB
Then listen to me, Mister
Starbuck. There is one God
that is lord over the earth,
and one Captain who's lord
over the Pequod! GET BACK
TO YOUR POST!
Starbuck sees the burning fire in Ahab's eyes and
realizes there is no way to reason with this man.
STARBUCK
As you wish, Captain. You
needn't beware of Starbuck...
(eyes burning back)
But let Ahab beware of AHAB!
Beware of YOURSELF, old man!
Stunned by his words, Ahab's rage dissipates. He
lowers the musket, regarding him curiously.
AHAB
You face me like a brave man,
shipmate. Yet you obey me.
Resigned to it, Starbuck turns and opens the door.
AHAB (cont'd)
You're too good of a man,
Starbuck.
Starbuck turns back. A calm but fierce expression.
STARBUCK
135
I wish I were not.
He quickly exits.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Queequeg sits at the foot of the mast, hunched over
a tiny fire of wood shavings on the deck. He CHANTS a
Polynesian ritual, praying to his Yojo.
Ishmael hunkers down before him, terribly concerned.
ISHMAEL
Queequeg! What's got into
ye, man! If ye don't work,
you'll get a floggin' for
sure! Queequeg -- speak
to me!
Queequeg chants away, withdrawn into himself. Dagoo
leans over him and shakes his head.
DAGOO
He's got de voodoo in 'im.
Tashtego appears and kneels down with a handful of
wood shavings. He drops them beside Queequeg.
Queequeg feeds the shaving into the fire without a
word. Just his low, rhythmic, rumbling chant.
ISHMAEL
Tashtego, what do ye think
ails him?!
TASHTEGO
His spirit is ill. It be
his time to die.
He looks at Queequeg with deep understanding. Sings
a low-voiced INDIAN PRAYER, as if to guide him along.
ISHMAEL
Time to die?! What manner
of nonsense is that?!
He shakes Queequeg hard, desperate to bring him around.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
136
Queequeg! Enough of this!
No response. Ishmael rises up, exasperated and afraid.
He turns to Dagoo, shaking his head.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Such madness! First the old
man, then Pip, now Queequeg...
are we all goin' mad?!
DAGOO
It's Ahab, I tell ye. He's
put de voodoo in alla us!
Starbuck strides angrily across the middeck from the
cabin. He stops to behold Queequeg's burning ritual.
STARBUCK
What the devil is this?
ISHMAEL
My friend's not well, sir.
STARBUCK
Queequeg, put out that flame!
You'll set the whole ship
on fire!
Queequeg suddenly looks up, as if foreseeing a vision.
QUEEQUEG
Ship on fire...aye! Whole
big ship! Ship all BURNS!...
(resigned to it)
An' Queequeg go him island
in sky.
Ishmael kneels down, gazing at him, trying to understand. Queequeg
clutches his arm in a vice-like grip.
QUEEQUEG (cont'd)
Quick...fetch carpenter!
DAGOO
I'll fetch 'im for ye, mate.
He hurries off. Ishmael leans close to Queequeg.
ISHMAEL
137
Why d'ye need the carpenter?
QUEEQUEG
Need him build canoe...like
dem canoes place 'em inside
when dem Nantucket whalemen
dead! Dark wood...like dem
war-wood canoes on me island!
STARBUCK
What on earth is he saying?
ISHMAEL
He's talking about a coffin.
QUEEQUEG
To lie him in and take him
go island in sky! Not in me
foc'sle hammock, sabee?
Ishmael nods, saddened. He translates to Starbuck,
as Dagoo appears with the Carpenter.
ISHMAEL
He's asking us not to bury
him in his hammock, but to
set him afloat in a canoe...
(rises up)
A coffin. He's spoken to
me about this before...it's
how warriors are buried in
his homeland.
Starbuck shakes his head in bafflement.
The Carpenter shuffles forward.
CARPENTER
Aye, so? What's he want?
ISHMAEL
A coffin that floats. Can
ye manage that?
The Carpenter shrugs. Without a second thought, he
produces a string and measures Queequeg's tattooed
body, length and breadth. Then he shuffles away.
During this, Queequeg mutters a final prayer to his
Yojo...then promptly tosses it on the fire.
138
ISHMAEL
Queequeg! That's your god!
QUEEQUEG
No more. Don't matter wedder
be Fiji god or Nantucket god,
no more god on dis ship...
(deep whisper)
No more god.
He withdraws back into his chanting, impervious now
to Ishmael, lost in a world beyond communication.
Ishmael looks plaintively between Starbuck, Dagoo and
Tashtego. Their grim expressions offer no solace.
The Yojo burns. An ominous chill to the scene.
FADE OUT.
ACT 5
EXT. CAPE HOPE SEAS - BEFORE DAWN
The dusk before sunrise. The Pequod rests on choppy,
windswept seas. In b.g., the dark silhouette of a
mountainous mass of land. The South African coast.
INT. FORECASTLE - BEFORE DAWN
Darkened, oil lamps swinging. Men sleep in their
bunks. A lone shadow creeps past and upstairs.
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - BEFORE DAWN
Pip sleeps in Ahab's bunk, twitching from terrible
dreams. The Captain sleeps fitfully in an armchair by
the bunk. He too has nightmares, his sweat-sheened
head tossing from side to side, his fists clenched.
One of his hands momentarily opens, torn by his
fingernails...his palm bloody.
EXT. MIDDECK - BEFORE DAWN
Strong winds buffet the deck. Queequeg sits rigidly
139
under the mast in the same spot, as if in a frozen
coma. A squall whips away the ashes before him.
Ishmael sleeps close by his friend, huddled in a
blanket. MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS stirs him awake. Not
moving, he watches a shadow streak across the deck.
A small dinghy drops overboard, SPLASHES down, its
tow line strung to the deck above.
A figure leans over the landward railing, feeding
out rope. Bulkington, his back turned to us. He
starts to climb over -- a hand clamps on his shoulder.
Starbuck behind him. Bulkington stiffens defensively.
STARBUCK
Clutch my soul! Have ye
gone mad too, Bulkington?
BULKINGTON
I got a young bride waitin'
for me, sir. It's not my
fate to die with that man.
He nods toward the captain's cabin. Starbuck seems
to understand...then slowly reaches into a coat
pocket.
Bulkington tenses. The Bowie knife materializes
in his hand.
BULKINGTON
I always liked ye, Starbuck,
but don't try to stop me.
Starbuck stops, hand in his coat. A long, tense
beat between them. Then...he withdraws a letter.
STARBUCK
It's for my missus. If ye
make it to Nantucket, I'd be
grateful if ye'd pass it on.
Bulkington nods and takes the letter. A moment of
communion between two reasonable men. They look at
the silhouetted African vista against the dusky sky.
BULKINGTON
Why don't ye give it to her
140
yourself? There's room in
the boat.
Starbuck smiles and shakes his head. Bulkington
leaps over and starts to climb down the ship's side.
He takes his knife and cuts the tow line. Then
stabs it down into the bulwark top.
BULKINGTON (cont'd)
You'll need that more than
me. May God go with ye, mate!
With that, he descends into his boat. Starbuck steps
up to the bulwark to watch him:
EXT. CAPE HORN SEAS - BEFORE DAWN
Bulkington rows fast toward the rocky shore, the dinghy
a dark form on the choppy, treacherous waters.
EXT. MIDDECK - BEFORE DAWN
Starbuck gazes longingly after him. His eyes sweep along
the expanse of land beyond, then turns back on Bulkington:
EXT. CAPE HORN SEAS - BEFORE DAWN
In the distance, the dinghy rides the crest of a steep wave
then dips down, propelled too quickly toward the shore rocks! The
boat smashes against the rocks -- its timbers shatter
out from a powerful, crashing wave! Bulkington is gone.
EXT. MIDDECK - BEFORE DAWN
Starbuck looks on in abject horror. He shuts his eyes from
the doomed sight, slamming a fist against the bulwark top
with angry despair. He lowers his head in grief and opens
his eyes. His grim gaze falls on:
The big Bowie knife, protruding from the top.
EXT. CAPE HOPE SEAS - DAY
The Pequod approaches the blustery Cape of Good Hope, her
bow dipping in the swells.
The horizon before her is black with thunderheads. A storm
dead ahead.
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY
141
Chess pieces are scattered around Pip, who lies on the floor. He
plays a game of battle between the black king and the
white whale's tooth, crashing them against each other with animated
sounds.
PIP
Crish, crash, damn yer eyes!
Die, ye white fiend! Splash!
Beware the tail, splat! Ahh!
Ahab pores over his sea charts, exhausted for lack of sleep. The
overhead lamps swings, the cabin sways. Distracted by
Pip, Ahab half-smiles at the boy.
The door cracks open, and Starbuck peers in.
STARBUCK
Sorry to disturb ye, sir.
Ahab goes back to his maps without reply, his usual severe manner.
Starbuck steps in and stands by the door, acting
polite to hide his contempt.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
The oil barrels are leaking,
sir. The cask wood's rotten.
AHAB
So? Tar them up.
STARBUCK
It would be more prudent to
ship into the next port and
replace the lot of 'em.
AHAB
Mister Starbuck, we'll not
stray from our course. Is
that understood?
STARBUCK
We're losin' our profit, sir.
Would ye wish to strip the
men of all hopes of cash?
AHAB
(an ironic tone)
Cash...aye, a hard matter that.
Hard it is that to fire others,
142
the match must be wasted.
(dismissing him)
Tar up the barrels.
STARBUCK
That won't be good enough--
AHAB
Mind your words, Starbuck!
Those are my orders.
Hard looks between them. Seething under the surface,
Starbuck starts to speak again...
AHAB (cont'd)
That is all!
Starbuck turns away, eying him with pity and hatred.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
The deck pitches and rolls on the brewing seas. Men
climb spider-like across the yards, trying to control
the wind-beaten sails. Stubb shouts up at them:
STUBB
Furl those t'gallant sails!
And close reef them topsails,
fore and aft!
Starbuck marches over to them, shouting over the wind.
STARBUCK
A word with you, Stubb! You
too, Flask!
FLASK
What, now?!
STARBUCK
Now!
The three hurry away. Under SHRIEKING wind, a SOUND
from below deck: the BANGING of the Carpenter's hammer.
At the foot of the main mast, Queequeg is still frozen
in the same position. Chanting prayers, oblivious to
the blasting wind and tossing deck.
Kneeling beside him, Ishmael prods a cup of steaming
143
chowder at him.
ISHMAEL
For Christ's sake, Queequeg,
ye got to eat! Come on now,
just a few sips, then ye can
go back to your prayers...
Queequeg keeps chanting at a steady rhythm, as if
Ishmael doesn't exist. Ishmael gives up in despair.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
My poor savage...my pagan
friend who'd gladly die for
me...don't ye understand?!
I don't want ye to die!
The Carpenter appears, hauling a coffin up on deck.
He loses his balance from the pitch of the ship,
falling under the coffin's heavy weight.
Ishmael hastens over to help him. Crewmen ignore
the struggling pair, turning superstitious faces away
to avoid looking at the coffin. Dragging it across
to the mast, the two slide it before Queequeg.
Suddenly aware of the coffin, Queequeg snaps back
to reality. He leans forward to examine it.
The Carpenter opens the lid and gives him a look.
CARPENTER
Got to do a fittin'.
Queequeg nods, understanding. He takes his harpoon
and rises unsteadily on cramped legs. Then steps
into the coffin and lies down like a model corpse,
resting the harpoon on his chest.
Ishmael watches, deeply chagrined by it all.
The Carpenter nods, satisfied. Queequeg rises and
steps out. He squats back down against the mast
and continues chanting. Completely tuned out again.
INT. BARREL HOLD - DAY
The dark bowels of the ship. Oil barrels are piled
high against the hull. The three mates stand in an
144
inch of leaking oil covering the floor, balancing
themselves to the ship's lilting sway.
Starbuck illuminates the sinister hold with a lamp,
Stubb and Flask staring at him.
STUBB
How d'ye mean, "usurpation"?
STARBUCK
A captain cannot use a ship
for ill-gotten gains, other
than for the purposes of her
owners. It's in the code
of merchant seamen.
FLASK
We're not merchantmen, we're
whalers.
Starbuck gestures down at the oil-flooded floor,
charged with angry energy.
STARBUCK
Are ye that blind to what's
happenin' here? All that we
toiled for is bein' wasted --
and HE'LL not lift a finger
to save it! He doesn't CARE!
Disturbed by him, Stubb starts to lights his pipe
with a cinder. Flask leans forward urgently.
FLASK
Careful there, Stubb! The
whole damn ship could go up.
Eying the oil leak, Stubb cautiously puts the pipe away.
STUBB
What're ye proposin', mate?
STARBUCK
We have the legal right to
refuse all further obedience.
We can even wrest command of
this ship.
Stubb trades disconcerting looks with Flask.
145
STUBB
That's dangerous talk...I
can't abide by it. If the
Capt'n says to tar up the
barrels, let's tar 'em up.
STARBUCK
Open your eyes, man! We're
not whalers any more, we're
just sheep followin' a
madman! Wanderin' from
all mortal reason!
STUBB
Aye, that might be true...
but Ahab's still capt'n. And
a fearless one at that!
FLASK
Aye, a mighty capt'n! The
king of the seas, the lord of
leviathans -- we can't go up
against that!
Starbuck turns away, frustrated, trying to collect
his wits to get through to them.
STARBUCK
Listen to me well, mates:
a fearless man is far more
dangerous than a coward.
No storms nor whales can
match the terrors menacing
us from the brow of an angry
man! We MUST NOT let Ahab's
fatal pride drag this ship
down to doom with him!
STUBB
But MUTINY, sir! That's an
idea born of an undigested
stomach. That's a killin'
ground you're standing on!
FLASK
Aye! I'll have no part of it!
He turns and climbs out of the hold. Starbuck looks
at Stubb with unyielding eyes. Stubb shakes his head.
STUBB
146
This is a sharkish business
we're in, Starbuck. Are ye
shark enough for THIS?
STARBUCK
I can no longer stand by to
the willful murder of this
good crew. I cannot obey my
God by obeying HIM! Do ye
understand me, Stubb?
STUBB
I do, mate. But I ain't a
religious man, nor a brave
one. Ye stand alone.
EXT. CAPE HOPE SEAS - DUSK
Dark thunderclouds blot out the sunset. The Pequod
drives on between mountainous waves that seem to
engulf it. Dead ahead...a black, roiling tempest.
EXT. MIDDECK - DUSK
Powerful winds pound the deck. Stubb shouts at
sailors on the rigging.
STUBB
Back the mainyard and break
out the mainhold! A sea
storm's comin' to greet us!
He stares at Starbuck, who paces the aft deck and
glances repeatedly at the Captain's cabin. Stubb
frowns, sensing his moral dilemma.
Ishmael pulls hard on a halyard, turning to glimpse
his friend: Queequeg still sits in the same place,
swaying to the ship's rise and fall. The coffin
slides around him.
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DUSK
Pip sleeps on the floor amidst a flotsam of chess
pieces, curled up peacefully at Ahab's feet like a
napping pup.
Dozing in his armchair, Ahab resembles more a weary
old pensioner than a raging tyrant. The cabin sways
147
around him, STORM WINDS HOWLING in b.g. Ahab opens
his tired eyes and peers down at Pip.
AHAB
Poor, gentle, mad Pip...
He opens a locket and gazes at a miniature portrait
of his young wife and baby son in better times. His
warm gaze turns dark and bitter. He shuts away the
locket from sight and mind. Stormy again.
AHAB (cont'd)
Oh, were I the wind! I'd
blow no more on this wicked,
wolfish world! Where lies
that final harbor, where we
unmoor no more?...
He clutches his forehead, wracked by a strange agony.
AHAB (cont'd)
God, stave my brain -- how
he GORES me! Accursed whale,
begone from my head, or I'll
clear the world of thee!
(looks madly around)
If I could only sleep...but
Ahab never sleeps, he only
feel, feels, feels! Aye,
that's tingling enough for
mortal man!
He focuses on the twisted sheets of his bunk, tormented.
AHAB (cont'd)
My grave-dug berth, my tomb.
Ahab and anguish, together
in one hammock. Dear God...
I must sleep...
He rests back in the chair and dozes off again.
A long beat. A shadow creeps into the cabin. We follow
the padded footfalls of wet boots across the floor...up to
a pair of trousers...then the Bowie knife in Starbuck's
hand.
Starbuck looms over dozing Ahab in the armchair. The
swinging lamp casts surreal, dancing shadows. Slowly
raising the glistening blade, Starbuck inches toward
the Captain...then stops, staring down at Pip,
148
sleeping docilely at his feet.
Starbuck lowers the knife. He can't do it. Ahab
stirs. Starbuck buries the knife away in his belt.
Ahab's groggy eyes blink open, focusing on the
figure before him.
AHAB
What...what is it?
A ferocious GALE RISES above deck, matching the
storm on Starbuck's face.
STARBUCK
A storm, Captain.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
A typhoon rages! Huge waves sledge-hammer the deck!
Men rush about the washed deck in the blasting winds
and torrential rain, lashing down everything in sight.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
At the helm Stubb struggles to keep the wheel steady,
fighting for balance, singing at the top of his lungs:
STUBB
Oh, jolly is the gale, and a
joker is the whale! Such a
sporty, jokey, hokey-pokey
lad is the ocean, oh!
Starbuck climbs up the quarterdeck steps toward him.
STARBUCK
Avast, mate! Let the storm
do the singin'! Be a braver
man and hold your tongue!
Stubb laughs -- a gigantic wave washes over them! He
shakes the sea water from his eyes.
STUBB
I told ye I weren't a brave
man, Starbuck! I'm a coward,
if truth be known...and I'll
sing to keep up my spirits!
No way to stop me, sir, but
to cut my throat!
149
STARBUCK
Well, jump overboard and
sing away, if you must!
Ahab appears on deck, face illuminated by a blinding
flash of lightning. A deafening THUNDER CLAP!
Starbuck and Stubb regard him warily. Stubb grips the
wheel harder, trying to control it.
STUBB
Bad work, Mister Starbuck!
Bad work! The sea's havin'
its way! We can't fight it!
Nobody can! Not even HIM!
Starbuck helps him with the wheel, looking up: torn
sails flap violently, men nearly thrown off the rigging.
STARBUCK
We'll go no further in this
squall! We must turn round!
He struggles his way toward the Captain.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Queequeg sits glued to the foot of the mast, chanting,
undaunted by the tempest. Sea water washes over him.
Ishmael staggers over, holding on for dear life.
ISHMAEL
Queequeg! Get below!
(tugging at him)
Come on, mate -- you'll be
washed overboard!
Queequeg will not budge. Another powerful wave slams
Ishmael against the mast!
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Ahab clings to a rail, unbending in the wind, his eyes
fixed outward to the boiling sea. Starbuck hurries
desperately over.
STARBUCK
150
Captain, sir! We could turn
this gail into a fair wind if
we TURN ABOUT -- let it drive
us toward home! Leeward,
sir, and homeward!
AHAB
Don't lecture me, Starbuck,
I know these seas as I know
myself! Never think this
voyage over -- before Moby
Dick is in my grasp!
A wave crashes over them -- Starbuck collides against
the deckhouse! Ahab holds fast, rooted to the rail.
Starbuck grapples his way back toward him.
STARBUCK
IN THE NAME OF GOD, AHAB!
WE MUST TURN ABOUT!
AHAB
You heard my orders! WE
DRIVE ON!
ISHMAEL (O.S.)
Starbuck!! Help us!!
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Ishmael clings to the mast, gripping Queequeg, trying
to keep him from washing away. Queequeg sits there,
making no move to save himself from the onslaught.
Starbuck rushes over and grabs a handhold by the mast.
STARBUCK
Get 'im below!
ISHMAEL
He won't move, sir!
Grabbing a rope, Starbuck hoists Queequeg up.
STARBUCK
Let's raise 'im up...against
the mast!
151
The two struggle to lift the limp giant to a standing
position, flat against the mast. Starbuck lashes him
to it, wrapping the rope around his chest and waist.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Ahab stands rigid, defiant against the storm. A
vision catches his eye, far out to sea:
EXT. CAPE HOPE SEAS - NIGHT
A large white form materializes over the crests of
giant waves. Indistinguishable, it could be a huge
whitecap...or it could be a white whale.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Ahab glowers at it with murderous eyes. To him,
it is Moby Dick. He spins around toward the crew
below, pointing outward.
AHAB
He's THERE, men! He's riding
the storm with us!
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Holding on, the men turn seaward. They see nothing.
Starbuck shouts up from the mast:
STARBUCK
Captain -- leave that whale
to his ghostly wanderings!
We must save our ship!!
A lightning bolt strikes a life raft at the stern
with a violent CRACK -- the raft flies overboard
and falls burning into the sea!
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Ahab turns back and fixes on the image at sea:
EXT. CAPE HOPE SEAS - NIGHT
Visible now in the flashes of lightning, like a
blurry mirage, MOBY DICK plunges through swells and
whitecaps. Following the same course as the ship.
152
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Convinced of what he sees, Ahab gestures over the
heaving rail like a messiah.
AHAB
Behold, shipmates! Believe
your own eyes -- he's THERE!
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
The men stagger to reach the bulwark. All stare out
into the black maelstrom, straining their eyes.
EXT. CAPE HOPE SEAS - NIGHT
Thousands of whitecaps over dark, raging waters. But
no sign of a whale.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Ahab points and exhorts the men below, spurring them on.
AHAB
THERE! D'ye see him?! Look
at him! See his white brow,
his magnitude, his malignity!
Most monstrous, mountainous
sea mastodon, against whom we
will declare everlasting war!
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Flask, caught up in Ahab's delusion, points excitedly.
FLASK
There!! I see him, Capt'n!
EXT. CAPE HORN SEAS - NIGHT
Over whitecaps, the same blurry mirage -- MOBY DICK!
Swimming parallel to the ship, drawing closer.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Stubb spots him too and nods enthusiastically, echoed
quickly by the rest of the crew.
153
STUBB/CREW
Aye! I see him too! There
he blows! Clear as day!
FLASK
By flukes! Is he a ghost?!
AHAB
Nay! He's as real as DEATH!
Behind them, Starbuck sees nothing. He edges beside
Ishmael who clings to the mast with dazed Queequeg.
Straining to see, Ishmael turns to Starbuck.
ISHMAEL
Where is he, sir?! I don't
see him!
STARBUCK
Of course ye don't! The old
man's blastin' all reason
straight out of their heads!
Another tidal wave plows over them with piledriver
force -- Starbuck and Ishmael topple over each other!
Queequeg stands secure, like Ulysses bound to the mast,
chanting dazedly. Starbuck rises determinedly and
bounds up the quarterdeck steps.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Starbuck takes the wheel from Stubb and turns it full
circle with all his might. The deck lurches to port.
Ahab wheels around in rage.
AHAB
Avast! Away from there!!
He seizes the wheel from Starbuck, demented with fury.
AHAB (cont'd)
Touch not that wheel, or I'll
strike ye into eternity!!
He wrenches Starbuck away and spins the wheel back -- the
ship careens to starboard with whiplash force!
Men are thrown across the middeck. Flattened against
the deckhouse, Starbuck shouts at Ahab.
154
STARBUCK
We must turn about or we'll
PERISH!
AHAB
Nay, I say! We'll DRIVE ON!
STARBUCK
WE'LL LOSE THIS SHIP!!
Undaunted and driven, Ahab helms the ship back into the
storm. Starbuck dashes back down to middeck.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
A titantic wave sweeps across the deck, submerging
everyone! A screaming deckhand washes overboard!
Ishmael clamps himself to the mast, holding Queequeg
close -- the two momentarily underwater. Drenched
crewmen cling to shrouds, battling for ground against
wind and sea. Their eyes stare up toward:
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Ahab at the wheel, riding the storm, wind beating his
face, whipping back his hair, a man obsessed. Suddenly...
a phosphorescent glow reflects off his face.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
Struggling with a halyard, Starbuck and Ishmael glance
up at a bizarre phenomenon:
A green, ghoulish flash skips along the top rigging,
sparking out veins of electrical discharge!
ISHMAEL
What is it?!...
STARBUCK
St. Elmo's fire!...
The other men don't see it, their eyes glued on Ahab...
EXT. QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
His body and the wheel all aglow in the otherworldly
155
green light -- flashing veins sparking down the stern
mast onto the high deck! A ghostly, mystical sight.
Then, just as suddenly...
The storm abates, as if in the eye of a hurricane.
The deck keeps pitching, wind still HOWLING, rain
flying aft...but the assault of waves recedes.
EXT. MIDDECK - NIGHT
All the men stand frozen, staring up at glowing Ahab,
dominating the ship -- as if it is he who has quelled
the storm. Then they gape higher up, aghast:
The St. Elmo's fire spreads across the tops of the
masts, filtering down over sails and rigging! Its
green hue transforms -- into a blinding whiteness!
STUBB
God have mercy on us all!!
The crew staggers back in fear. Dagoo reflexively
seizes his harpoon to protect himself. Tashtego falls
to his knees, praying for his life. Even Fedallah
and his Arabs fall back in terrified awe. Ahab
THUNK-CLOPS down to middeck with a triumphant air.
AHAB
Aye! Aye, shipmates! Mark
it well! The white flame
but lights the way to the
WHITE WHALE!
He snatches the harpoon away from Dagoo and holds it
up into the static stratosphere just above his head...
A blinding flash! A ring of St. Elmo's fire engulfs
the harpoon head -- shining a white, sparkling beacon!
The men GASP in unison, trembling before him. Starbuck,
the lone disbeliever, gazes hard at Ahab's grand
performance. Ishmael gapes.
ISHMAEL
Jesus Christ in heaven! What
is he doing?!
STARBUCK
Oh, he knows exactly what
he's doing!
156
Ahab laughs defiantly, scans the awestruck faces of
his crew then stares deep into the crackling light.
AHAB
Leap! Leap up and lick the
sky! I leap with you, burn
with you -- I command the
very HEAVENS!
A forked light deflects off the harpoon tip, casting a
laser beam off at a high angle. Ahab turns the harpoon, reflecting
the light down -- towards the main mast. The
magical beam burns down the length of the mast, hitting
the gold doubloon. The coin shines brilliantly, sparks flickering
out like white sun rays!
Controlled by Ahab's harpoon, the beam travels down onto Queequeg's
face. Ishmael and Starbuck recoil back. The
harpooner's eyes brighten, as if he sees an angel.
Starbuck can stand no more. He dashes over.
STARBUCK
No, Ahab! Don't do this!
Enough witchcraft, old man,
God will turn against you!
T'is an ill voyage, ill
begun and ill done! Stop
this blasphemy, Captain --
STOP IT NOW!!
He seizes his arm to stop him. Ahab hurls him away with
inhuman strength. He booms at the crew, his wide eyes translucent
with maniacal fervor.
AHAB
All your oaths, shipmates, are
AS BINDING AS MINE! Make no
mistake! Heart, body and soul,
lungs and life, Ahab is BOUND!
He lifts the glowing harpoon higher above his head --
its glow intensifies, lighting up his whole body!
QUEEQUEG
Cap'n!! Cap'n!!
Ishmael turns in shock. Queequeg struggles at the
ropes, suddenly and fully conscious, his lucid eyes
157
focused on Ahab. Ishmael quickly unties him.
Queequeg staggers to Ahab, as if he's just seen God.
QUEEQUEG (cont'd)
Queequeg sabee!...Queequeg see!
He falls to Ahab's feet, clutches them worshippingly.
QUEEQUEG (cont'd)
Me Cap'n...me Cap'n...me GOD!
Stubb and Flask, their faces aglow in Ahab's white
light, kneel before him on the pitching, windy deck.
Dagoo drops to his knees beside Tashtego. Fedellah
and the Arabs genuflect, prostrate before the master.
Removed from it all, Ishmael puzzles over this mad
scene. He watches Starbuck: angry but stricken,
fighting all the temptations of the devil.
Ahab extends a fatherly hand to Starbuck, yearning
for his soul as well.
AHAB
Ye see, Starbuck? My pulse
makes these very planks beat!
(to his men)
Look, shipmates! Raise your
heads! Look here as I blow
out your last fear! ALL OF
IT! GONE!!
He blows on the flaming white beacon of his harpoon --
the light is extinguished!
Above, a blinding lightning flash! A deafening THUNDER
CRACK!
Then darkness...as the winds rise and the storm returns
full fury. A primordial flooding from both sea and sky.
FADE OUT.
ACT 6
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAWN
The storm has passed. Thin, layered clouds blend
with a dazzling, bright-colored sunrise. The Pequod
158
sails toward the sun on calm seas, leaving the Cape
far behind.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - DECK/MASTS - DAWN
A deathly quiet reigns over the deck, like a ghost
ship. Broken spars and scattered rigging from the
storm lie about, unattended to. The ship seems at
first glance deserted, but there are seamen about...
Dough-Boy, aloft in the lookout. Dagoo and Tashtego
squat on the bow gunwale, harpoons in hand, eyes
fixed on the horizon with warrior-like intensity.
Stubb cons the ship on the wheeldeck, puffing his
pipe. Flask at the helm. Both gaze steadily
seaward with fanatical concentration.
Fedallah and his crew straddle yard arms, staring
uniformly out to sea. Zealous sentinels, watching
and waiting.
Not a sound from anyone. No talking, no laughter,
not even from Stubb. All are focused on whatever
is out there. All with one singular purpose.
INT. BARREL HOLD - DAWN
By flickering lamplight, a chaos of scattered casks
broken by the storm. Cracked barrels bleed oil...
six inches over the flooded floor now.
Holding the lamp, Starbuck stares appalled at the
damage. A total loss.
INT. FORECASTLE - MORNING
The rest of the crew sleeps in exhaustion.
Queequeg and Ishmael sit at a mess table over
breakfast. His normal self, Queequeg shovels away
an immense pile of food on his plate, consuming it
with gusto. He's starving. Ishmael studies him
with ironic awe.
ISHMAEL
I just don't fathom ye. You
said you were goin' to die!
159
QUEEQUEG
Only man go dead WANTS to
go dead. No bad magic kill
man NOT want to go dead!
Only big things...big fire,
big water, big whale dat don't
THINK! Only dat kill man not
want to go dead! Sabee?
Queequeg smiles charismatically and stuff his mouth.
Ishmael sighs, watching his feeding frenzy.
ISHMAEL
I think I'll draft my will.
You can be my witness.
QUEEQUEG
Aye! Queequeg much happy to!
Ishmael ponders to himself, clearly distressed.
INT. STARBUCK'S CABIN - DAWN
Starbuck sits hunched over the edge of his bunk
and leafs through his bible, brooding distractedly.
Ishmael appears in the doorway, looking troubled.
ISHMAEL
Don't mean to bother ye, sir.
Starbuck looks up, agitated. Then nods patiently.
STARBUCK
What is it, Ishmael?
ISHMAEL
I don't know, sir, I just...
I feel such dread. What's
gotten over this crew? They
all seem to have lost their
wits, like they cannot think.
Starbuck shuts the bible and runs his hand through
his hair, more troubled than Ishmael.
STARBUCK
They don't see his madness,
Ishmael...they can't. HE
won't give 'em a chance to
think! Only to feel. And
160
they feel they must obey him.
(a resigned nod)
Oh, I'll obey him as well...
but I'll hate him for it!
ISHMAEL
Perhaps I must obey him too.
STARBUCK
Don't. Don't give in. At
least not in your heart!
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - MORNING
Dressed and ready for battle, Ahab puts on his top hat.
He turns to leave -- Pip scurries over and wraps his
arms around his leg. Frightened, a strangled whisper:
PIP
Master, master...don't go!
Ahab turns, unusually patient and affectionate.
AHAB
No, lad. Ye mustn't follow
Ahab. Not now...not ever!
(losing patience)
Ye have the wrong effect on
me, son...like a cure to a
malady I must keep as my own.
Now do as I say and stay here.
I'll have them serve ye -- as
though you were Captain!
PIP
No, please! Use me as yer leg!
Lemme be a part of you!
AHAB
Don't speak to me so, Pip...
don't! My purpose will keel
up in me, and I tell ye...
it CANNOT BE!
Pip cries out. Ahab is torn by his voice, angry now.
AHAB (cont'd)
Weep and I'll murder ye, boy!
For Ahab too is mad!
Pip sobs uncontrollably, refusing to let go. Ahab
161
relents and squats down to comfort him. The boy hugs
him tight, tears flowing. Ahab sighs, agonizing.
AHAB (cont'd)
Oh, you're true, aren't ye,
Pip! As the circumference to
its center...
He pulls back gently, gazing into his little face.
AHAB (cont'd)
Listen to me. If ye stay here,
you'll hear my ivory foot on
the deck. Then you'll know
that I'm there.
Pip lets go and looks at him with sad, tearful eyes.
AHAB (cont'd)
Ye stay put now and be my
commander. My Captain Pip!
Pip sniffles, nods and puffs his chest out proudly.
PIP
Aye, aye -- Capt'n Pip!
Moved by him, Ahab pats his head and leaves.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
White seabirds soar over the ship, their HIGH-PITCHED
SQUAWKS unsettling the men on deck. Albatrosses.
Crewmen clear away broken spars and rigging, repair
sails and scrub the deck. No sound of voices, except...
CARPENTER (O.S.)
I don't like it!
The Carpenter is tarring the inside of the coffin,
sealing the seams with pitch. Stubb stands over
him, listening to his irate grumblings.
CARPENTER (cont'd)
I make a coffin for Queequeg
but now HE don't want it --
and now YOU want me to turn
it into a LIFE BUOY! It's...
162
it's just plain undignified!
STUBB
Well, there's nothin' else for
it. We lost the old one, we
need a new one. So stop yer
complainin' -- just rig it!
The Carpenter snorts peevishly. Nearby, the Cook turns
with a mock command.
COOK
Hammer it good, ye old scamp!
We don't want a leaky coffin!
CARPENTER
(scowling back)
I'll hammer yer lips together
if ye don't shut up!
Stubb laughs at the two of them, his old self again.
STUBB (cont'd)
Just make a good job of it!
If the ship sinks, there'll
be thirty lively men fightin'
for one coffin -- and that's a
sight I don't want to miss!
The deckhands around them LAUGH, the mood on deck
brightening, until...
Familiar PEG LEG FOOTSTEPS cause a sudden hush. A
charged air of anticipation, as everyone glues their
eyes on...
EXT. QUARTERDECK - MORNING
Ahab emerges into the light, carrying a quadrant.
He squints into the sun and scans the men below.
Noticing the Carpenter working on the coffin, he
hobbles to the bannister and leans down.
AHAB
What is this, old man?
CARPENTER
A life buoy, Capt'n. Mister
163
Stubb's orders.
AHAB
You're the legmaker, are ye
not?
CARPENTER
Yessir, so I am.
AHAB
Are ye also the undertaker?
CARPENTER
Aye, sir! 'Twas a coffin
before, sir, but now they got
me turnin' it into a buoy!
AHAB
A BUOY?! Ye might be a jack
of all trades, shipmate, but
you're as unprincipled as
the gods!
CARPENTER
I do what I do, sir!
AHAB
Look at ye, you old gray-
headed woodpecker -- turnin'
the dreaded symbol of grim
death into an instrument
of help and hope! Hah!
A life buoy of a coffin!
CARPENTER
Faith, sir...
AHAB
(sharply)
Faith?...what faith?
CARPENTER
Why, faith...just sort of an
exclamation like, sir.
Ahab glares over the remodeled coffin, dismissing
him with an irritable wave.
AHAB
Get that thing below where
164
it belongs! Let me not see
it again!
He hobbles to the center of the quarterdeck and
raises the quadrant, pointing it toward the sun.
Starbuck watches him evenly.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
The rest of the crew observe Ahab in silence, their
faces a mix of reverence and dread. Fedallah alights
down from his mast watch and squats low, studying
Ahab with sinister intensity.
EXT. QUARTERDECK - MORNING
Ahab takes measurements with the quadrant. He stops
and frowns up at the burning sun, speaking to it:
AHAB
Oh, high and mighty pilot...
ye can tell me where I am,
but can ye tell me where I
shall be...where HE is at
this very moment?
Pip steps anxiously from the cabin, decked out in
Ahab's oversized robe. A long-absent sight to the
crew. Their eyes follow him with strange curiosity.
Pip bolts across the deck and crouches at Ahab's
feet, fearful of the men, the ship, the sea all
around. He stays close to Ahab for protection.
Ignoring the boy, Ahab lowers his gaze and scans
the vast expanse.
AHAB (cont'd)
Where is Moby Dick?!
(up at the sun)
Ye can see him, can't ye?!
My eyes look at the very eye
that even now beholds HIM!
Ahab glares down at the quadrant in his hand. A
growing disgust spreads across his face...
AHAB (cont'd)
Foolish toy! A baby's play
thing for commodores! What
can ye do but tell me the
165
poor, pitiful point where YOU
happen to be now, but not one
jot more than that! Ye can't
tell me where one drop of
water will be tomorrow -- or
where be that WHITE WHALE!
Pip recoils from Ahab's feet, sliding away from him.
AHAB (cont'd)
You're IMPOTENT -- and with
your impotence you insult
the very SUN!
He suddenly raises the quadrant and SMASHES it down
on the deck, shattering it into useless pieces!
AHAB (cont'd)
Curse you, ye vain, paltry
thing! Thus I spit on ye!
I'll no longer guide my
earthly way by ye!
He crushes the broken pieces under his peg leg with
fury, then THUNK-CLOPS away.
Pip kneels over the quadrant pieces, studying them
for meaning like a gypsy reading tea leaves.
From all around, dumb reactions. Then the men go
about their business, as if nothing had happened.
Narrowing his eyes on Ahab, Starbuck rests a hand
over the buckhorn handle of the Bowie knife in his
belt. Touching it to muster false courage.
EXT. MIDDECK - MORNING
Swabbing the deck with Ishmael, Queequeg smokes his
tomahawk pipe. He offers it to Ishmael, who takes a
deep pull and hands it back. Smiles between them.
A distant, eerie SOUND distracts them: unearthly
WAILS and MOANS from out at sea, like the human
cries of lost souls. Ishmael squints seaward.
ISHMAEL
What could it be, Queequeg?
Whales?
166
Queequeg shakes his head, just as puzzled as he.
ISHMAEL (cont'd)
Sounds like the voices of
drowned men.
Others on deck hear it too, all eyes focusing out.
Looks of nervous forboding.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
The Pequod slashes through rolling swells, flying
all sails and heading true before the wind.
She passes an islet of sea-washed rocks...populated
by a colony of seals. Sunning on the rocks, they
WAIL that eerie, human-like CRY. As the Pequod
sails by, the seals flee into the water.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK - DAY
Crewmen watch the seals from the side, chuckling
among themselves.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
A distance apart on the port bow, Starbuck and
the Captain view the seals. Ahab turns to give
Starbuck a half-smile. Starbuck doesn't smile
back, turning his eyes to the horizon.
Ahab sidles over beside him, both looking out.
He breathes deep, sucking in the sea air.
AHAB
T'is a mild, mild wind, is
it not, Mister Starbuck?
And a mild-lookin' sky!
He turns away to scan the blue heavens. Hard,
nervous eyes fixed on his back, Starbuck slowly
reaches for the Bowie knife in his belt.
AHAB (cont'd)
On such a mild day as this,
I struck my first whale...
167
The knife inches out of Starbuck's belt, exposing
its long, sharp blade. Ahab's back is still turned.
AHAB (cont'd)
A boy harpooner of eighteen!
Forty years ago! Forty years
of whalin', of privation and
peril and storms! Aye...and
in all those years I have not
spent more than three ashore!
The knife is almost out. Fighting his conscience,
Starbuck wills himself to do it...
AHAB (cont'd)
Forty years of desolation
and solitude...whole oceans
away from that young wife I
wedded and gave a son.
The knife freezes in Starbuck's grasp, as he listens.
AHAB (cont'd)
Did I say WIFE? Rather a
WIDOW with her own husband
alive, poor girl! Her and
that sad, neglected spit of
a boy...my dear, sweet child.
Starbuck eases the knife back into his belt, too
swayed by decency and compassion. Ahab turns to him.
AHAB (cont'd)
Aye, Starbuck, I widowed 'em
both! With all the madness,
frenzy, boilin' blood and
smokin' brow that for a
thousand lowerings I have
chased my prey...more a
demon than a man!
Starbuck studies Ahab's face, trying to understand him
more than hate him. Ahab's brow tightens.
AHAB (cont'd)
How richer or better am I
now for all that effort?
(his head reels)
I feel deadly faint...oh
168
GOD, heal my cracked heart!
I feel so old...
He leans against Starbuck for support, drawing close
to him. Starbuck braces him steady.
AHAB (cont'd)
Come close to me, Starbuck...
let me look into a human eye.
It's better than to gaze into
sea or sky...or God Himself...
Their eyes lock. Ahab's gazes deeply into Starbuck's.
AHAB (cont'd)
I see my wife and my son in
those eyes, Starbuck. I see
home in them...faraway home!
Genuinely moved by him, Starbuck holds him close.
STARBUCK
My Captain! In these eyes
are MY wife, MY children --
and I fear I'll never see
them again!
He tightens his grip on him, begging earnestly:
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Let's sail away from these
wretched waters! Leave right
now, sir! Let me alter the
course -- head us back to
old Nantucket again!
Ahab pulls away, dark and stormy again. Frustrated
beyond reason, Starbuck prays to the sky with clenched
fists.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Great God in heaven -- SHOW
yourself to this man!
Impulsively, he yanks out the knife from his belt.
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Or give ME the strength to do
your bidding!
He turns toward Ahab, his teeth clenched, the blade
169
pointed to strike.
Ahab looks at the knife and regards him deeply, torn
with new conflicting emotions. He stares grimly to sea,
as if suddenly realizing his folly.
AHAB
What have I done? What cruel
master commands me?!
Starbuck stares at him, frozen in step, the knife poised.
AHAB (cont'd)
What IS this unearthly thing,
pushing me to do what in my own
heart I would not dare?!
A look of dark revelation, his eyes fixed on the far
horizon, gazing inward. Almost a whisper:
AHAB (cont'd)
Is Ahab...no longer Ahab?
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Dead ahead of the Pequod, bubbles rise on the sea's
surface...from deep below. They increase, until
water erupts with the release of air from some
great spout!
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
The tense tableau between Ahab and Starbuck is suddenly
broken by a bellowing cry above:
DOUGH-BOY (O.S.)
THAR SHE BLOWS!!
EXT. TOP MAST - DAY
High on lookout, Dough-Boy shakes with violent glee.
DOUGH-BOY (cont'd)
She blows! She blows! Dead
to the bow, Capt'n! It's
HIM -- the WHITE WHALE!
170
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Men tumble madly against the bulwarks and leap onto
gunwales, gaping out.
EXT. BOW DECK - DAY
Ahab and Starbuck stare dead ahead over the bow,
their eyes wide. Starbuck's knife lowers in his hand.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
A half-mile out, MOBY DICK breaches directly in the
Pequod's path -- his whole, gigantic body leaps high
out of the water! SPLASHING DOWN with the might of
a seaquake! Waves shoot up!
A tremendous blast of spout water explodes, filling
the air! Mist fills our view.
FADE OUT.
ACT 7
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
MOBY DICK's massive shape plows through the swells
in f.g., parallel to the dwarfed Pequod a hundred
yards away in b.g. A half-dozen broken harpoons
stick out of his white, mottled hump. A jet of
liquid air gushes from his great spout.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - DAY
Whalers' faces gape seaward. Starbuck, Stubb,
Flask, Ishmael, Queequeg, Tashtego, Dagoo, Fedallah.
With anticipation or dread, this is the moment
they've all been waiting for.
Ahab stands rigid, focused and still -- until
murderous rage explodes full force from his face.
AHAB
LOWER THE BOATS!
A frenzy of activity! Crewmen rush to the divets
to man the lowering chains.
171
Starbuck stands there a beat, powerless, his weapon
impotent in his hand. He puts it away and shouts up:
STARBUCK
In stunsails! Down the
topgallants!
Chaos on deck! Shouts and whistles, the BANGING
of wood blocks, RINGING of chainlinks, BEATING of
boots running over the plankings.
Fedallah stops by the gold coin on the mast, SLAPS
it greedily with a fist, dashes on. Others follow
suit, slapping the coin as they run by.
Queequeg, Tash and Dago snatch up their harpoons
in quick order.
Whalers pile into the swinging boats like pirates
on the attack -- some leaping from the deck. They
man the oars and rope lines.
Ahab storms out his cabin door, his two polished
harpoons in each hand. Pip runs frantically behind
him, trips on the oversized length of his robe.
He screams hysterically after Ahab:
PIP
Master, master...come back!
The sharks! The sharks!
Impervious to him, Ahab shouts to the Blacksmith:
AHAB
Light up those try-works,
blacksmith! We'll have tons
of blubber to burn tonight!
The Blacksmith turns to fuel the huge furnaces.
Over the side, whaleboats drop -- SLAPPING DOWN
on the water in quick succession. Fedallah's boat
is the first to set off, rowing with amazing speed.
Ahab climbs over and reacts to Fedallah's flight.
He waves his harpoons after him, out of his mind
with rage.
AHAB
172
Fedallah!! Come back, ye
heathenish traitor! Damn
your soul!
(shouts down)
Starbuck! Hold fast there!
He climbs down a rope by the strength of one arm
and lands into Starbuck's boat. Starbuck doesn't
have time to react. Ahab plows forward to the bow
on a nimble peg leg, pushing Queequeg aside.
AHAB (cont'd)
Row, ye blisterin' fools!
Pull with all your hearts!
Ishmael and the oarsmen row energetically, the
boat streaking out with Stubb's and Flask's boats.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Viewed from high above, the four tiny boats
converge on the whale like ants to a mole hill.
Fedallah's boat far in the lead.
White, SHRIEKING seabirds materialize in the sky,
circling chaotically around boats and whale.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
A mad race to get there first. Rowers work with
mindless concentration, muscle and rhythm in sync,
racing full speed ahead of Stubb's and Flask's boats.
Ahab exhorts them from the bow, leaning fiercely
forward, looking like Moses on a Red Sea.
AHAB
Pull, pull, ye murderous
rogues, dash on! BEACH me
on his white back! Do
that for me!
EXT. FEDALLAH'S BOAT - DAY
Silent, powerful strokes. Fedallah at the prow,
harpoon ready. Dead ahead...MOBY DICK, swimming at
a free, unhurried pace. A magnificent sight.
173
The rowers turn oars to flank him, drawing closer.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
The white leviathan looms tall, as Fedallah's
small boat streaks alongside his fins. MOBY DICK's
enormous tail SMACKS the water as if in challenge,
tossing up waves!
EXT. FEDALLAH'S BOAT - DAY
The boat rocks on the waves. Steady and swift
on the prow, Fedallah launches his harpoon with
superhuman strength -- into the massive white
midsection!
A VOLCANIC REACTION! Giant flukes beat the water,
a chaos of waves and foam! The spout exhales
angrily, as MOBY DICK charges away full speed!
The harpoon line goes taut -- the boat lurches
forward! Fedallah grips the line with a spirited
cackle, Arabs hanging on for a rollercoaster ride.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Towing Fedallah's boat, MOBY DICK lifts his huge
tail and sounds, seawater cascading from majestic
flukes like a waterfall. Down he goes!
EXT. FEDALLAH'S BOAT - DAY
The harpoon line suddenly goes slack. Reacting
curiously, Fedallah searches the waters. No
sign of his prey.
A tense, shuddery beat. In b.g., the other three
boats close in around him.
Fedallah glances up at the rapacious flights of
SHRIEKING birds above him. Then looks forward...
with sudden horror!
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
174
From his viewpoint, MOBY DICK breaches with a surge
of colossal energy -- charging forward, directly
toward us, his monstrous head splitting the water!
A terrifying image! His giant, crooked jaws open
to reveal huge, jagged teeth!
EXT. FEDALLAH'S BOAT - DAY
Fedallah, paralyzed with awe. His Arabs leap up
in terror and scramble for the sides...
Bearing down relentlessly, MOBY DICK's immense
head lurches up with gaping jaws -- takes the
whole boat into his mouth and SNAPS Fedallah and
the boat in two with crushing force!
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
With pieces of wrecked boat and human bodies still
in his jaws, MOBY DICK dives back into the deep!
Stillness over the sea. Only the SCREAMS of birds.
EXT. STUBB'S/FLASK'S BOATS - DAY
Their boats rocking in the wake of destruction,
Stubb and Flask stare awestruck, speechless. The
men look on in wondrous fear.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
Starbuck is dumbstruck, like the rest. Ishmael
shuts his eyes, foreseeing his doom. Queequeg
gazes stoically, accepting his.
Stunned for a beat, Ahab mutters a seaward growl:
AHAB
Gone! So ye've gone before
me, Fedallah -- but no ROPE
can smite me now! I'll slay
that demon yet!
As if in reply, a DEEP RUMBLE of bubbles rises in
the water before them. MOBY DICK breaches mightily
with a powerful geyser -- only twenty yards away!
175
He glides past, his spray raining over the boat.
STARBUCK
God in heaven!!
He and the others recoil in humbled terror. Ahab
leans forward and shouts with demonic triumph:
AHAB
Breach your last to the sun,
Moby Dick! Your hour...
(brandishes harpoons)
and THESE are at hand!
STARBUCK
Captain, it's not too late to
stop this madness! Let's
turn back--
AHAB
BE SILENT!
STARBUCK
I cannot! I'm under orders to
obey you, not to DIE for ye!
AHAB
But I AM under orders! I'm
the Fates' lieutenant! Pull
on, men, burst in upon him!
PULL! PULL!
Queequeg pulls hard, Ishmael and the frightened oarsmen
pulling to his beat.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
The chase is on again, building momentum. Starbuck's
boat closes in on the mountainous whale, Stubb's and
Flask's boats right behind them.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
The boat pulls close alongside, within twenty feet
of MOBY DICK.
AHAB
Steady, men, steady...
Hanging over the prow, his harpoon ready, Ahab is
176
close enough to strike. He sees the small eye in
MOBY DICK's titanic head and glowers fiercely at it.
AHAB (cont'd)
Accursed fish! May black
vomit wrench thee...
He raises the harpoon to strike, a mighty roar:
AHAB (cont'd)
From hell's heart I STAB at
thee!
A powerful thrust -- the harpoon strikes the side
of the head, joining other ancient spears! MOBY DICK
turns, barely flinching, his dark eye facing Ahab.
Ahab raises and aims his second harpoon...
AHAB (cont'd)
For hate's sake I spit my
last BREATH at thee!!
Another thrust! The harpoon hits directly above
the eye! MOBY DICK lunges forward, dragging the
boat full throttle! Men tumble over each other.
Ahab holds onto the tight harpoon lines, refusing
to let go -- he's wrenched overboard!
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Dragged hard through the water, pelted by waves
but holding on, Ahab pulls himself along the lines
toward the speeding leviathan!
EXT. WHALE BODY - DAY
With a ghastly grin, Ahab hoists himself up onto
the white mountainside and climbs up higher, using
stuck harpoons as rungs...toward the whale's hump!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
As the boat plows behind him, the rowers watch in
open-jawed amazement. Starbuck stares, inspired
by the heroic, horrific scene before him.
EXT. WHALE BODY - DAY
Ahab rides the whale, clinging on, his foot and
peg leg supported by impaled harpoons! In the
177
rushing chaos, their lines flail around Ahab's
legs and begin to entangle themselves around his
thighs, up to his waist...
Ahab yanks out an ancient lance -- stabs its sharp
point downward into MOBY DICK, again and again,
laughing and shouting with hateful exhilaration!
MOBY DICK submerges -- taking Ahab down with him!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
Starbuck leaps forward to the bow and leans out,
screaming in despair...
STARBUCK
My Captain!!
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
From Starbuck's viewpoint: MOBY DICK resurfaces,
still dragging the boat.
Fastened to the whale, dead Ahab sprawls upright
across his hump with a ravaged face -- wrapped up
in coils and coils of harpoon rope! His glazed
eyes wide open in fossilized fury, staring
directly at us!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
Starbuck's direful face fixes on Ahab.
STARBUCK
My Captain...my Captain...
He suddenly turns with a savage heart, transformed,
exhorting the others with Ahab's own mighty rage:
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Come on, men! Let's not
let him die in vain! Let's
gash that whale's heart --
let's SPILL HIS GORE!!
Seizing hold of the taut line, he pulls furiously
to drag the boat closer to their prey. Shouts back:
178
STARBUCK (cont'd)
Damn yer eyes, pull! PULL!
Queequeg grips a line and pulls with him. Caught
up in Starbuck's fever, the others take the lines.
Only Ishmael hangs back, too petrified to move.
EXT. STUBB'S BOAT - DAY
Witnessing the scene, Stubb angrily tosses his
pipe into the sea and seizes Tashtego's harpoon,
brave as fearless fire, shouting at his oarsmen:
STUBB
Thunder away at him, lads,
PULL! I'll strike at 'im
myself and send him to a
FIERY HELL!
EXT. FLASK'S BOAT - DAY
Flask echoes Stubb, inflamed with passion.
FLASK
Pull, dammit, pull! DEATH
to Moby Dick!!
Dagoo leaps onto the prow with raised harpoon and
a BOOMING WAR CRY.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Stubb's and Flask's boats advance rapidly toward
MOBY DICK -- the giant whale heading their way,
dragging Starbuck's boat behind him.
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
Starbuck and his men pull fiercely on the lines,
battling the racing tide, drawing closer and
closer to the whale's stern...twenty feet away!
Queequeg leaps to the bow. Fighting for balance,
he raises and aims his harpoon...
179
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
MOBY DICK suddenly accelerates, dragging the boat
faster! Then raises his mammoth head high -- and
dives straight down!
EXT. STARBUCK'S BOAT - DAY
The boat lurches up over a wave -- Queequeg tumbles
off the bow with his harpoon, Ishmael spills out
the stern! Airborn for a split second, the boat
plunges downward!
Starbuck SCREAMS before a wall of water rushing up
at him -- the last image he sees!
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Starbuck's boat plummets down into the deep with a
violent SPLASH -- disappears! It's over in seconds.
EXT. STUBB'S BOAT - DAY
Stubb hasn't time to react, as he looks down over
the bow:
Underwater, a massive white head breaches up toward
us from the depths with terrifying swiftness!
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
MOBY DICK shoots straight up out of the water like
an explosion -- lifting Stubb's boat high, rupturing
it! The boat splinters into pieces, scattering wood
and men far and wide!
Plunging back down with a huge SPLASH, the whale
wields its great tail over Flask's boat...
EXT. FLASK'S BOAT - DAY
Raised up, giant flukes CRASH DOWN atop the men's
heads with sledgehammer power -- crushing them,
their SCREAMS cut short! The tail smashes the
boat to smithereens!
180
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Nothing is left of Stubb, Flask, their men or
their boats but flotsam and floating bodies.
MOBY DICK turns away from the carnage and plows
his ominous way toward the ship itself.
Ishmael flounders in the choppy waters, trying to
keep his head afloat. He sees someone and swims
desperately toward him...
Queequeg drifts, clinging weakly to a floating oar.
The end of his harpoon juts oddly from the water.
Ishmael holds onto the oar, gasping, spitting water.
ISHMAEL
Queequeg! Hang on, mate!
You'll be all right!...
Then he sees the blood in the water: Queequeg's
harpoon has impaled one side of his waist from
the fall. Queequeg focuses weakly on his friend's
face...a glimmer of a smile. Then he lets go and
sinks.
ISHMAEL
Queequeg!!
Desperate to save him, Ishmael dives...
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
Queequeg sinks fast, surrendering to the depths.
Ishmael grips his arm to pull him up, Queequeg's
great weight pulling him down. Queequeg yanks
Ishmael's hand free, forcing him to save himself.
He disappears into the deep.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Ishmael surfaces, sucking in air. He clutches
the puny oar. And CRIES OUT in spiritual agony!
Far across the waters, MOBY DICK charges toward
the Pequod with renewed fury...then submerges.
181
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK - DAY
Among the stunned shipboard crewmen, the Cook
looks out over the faraway wreckage but sees no
sign of the whale. He turns to the main mast.
The Spanish gold coin is still there, nailed to
the mast. Eying it greedily, the Cook glances
around...then takes a kitchen knife and works at
the coin to pry it loose.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
From an aerial view: the drifting Pequod. A
half league out...an immense, white underwater
mass forges steadily toward the ship.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
At the mast, the Cook unloosens the gold coin.
He senses someone behind him and turns to see...
The grinning Carpenter's face -- WHACK! His
hammer knocks the Cook out cold. A gleeful grin.
CARPENTER
THAT'LL shut you up!
Taking his place, the Carpenter easily pries
off the coin and holds it up with a thieving
smile. He gazes at its golden glow, as...
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
MOBY DICK's white head surfaces and barrels
through the water with a great thrust of his
tail! Swimming faster and faster toward the
ship, an engine of destruction...
The whale COLLIDES head on into the Pequod with
the impact of a cannonball!
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
Quick devastation across the deck! The Carpenter
topples back against the mast. Rigging falls
around him, killing deckhands!
182
INT. LOWER HOLD - DAY
Tons of seawater pour through the splintered hull!
INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY
Terrified Pip dashes through the cabin and leaps
into Ahab's chest of peg legs. He shuts the lid
over himself to hide.
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - DAY
MOBY DICK'S giant tail sweeps across the deck,
his flukes toppling the pots on the lit furnaces!
Spilled whale oil ignites -- flames spread over
the planking, setting the deck on fire!
Burning oil pours down an open bow hatch into
the barrel hold...
INT. BARREL HOLD - DAY
Flames light up the oil-flooded floor, licking
all around the oil casks...KABLOOM!
EXT. PEQUOD (AT SEA) - DAY
An explosive fireball consumes the entire bow!
The middeck tilts askew. Fires sweep aft and rage
through the whole ship!
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Ishmael thrashes in the water, clinging helplessly
to the oar. In b.g., the distant Pequod burns and
sinks, flames and smoke roiling skyward.
EXT. MIDDECK - DAY
The ship goes down. Through the flames of the
low-tilting deck, the dead Carpenter hangs from
toppled rigging, flat against the mast...his arms
spread out like a crucifixion. In his open hand,
183
the Spanish gold coin.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
Ishmael struggles in the water, the lone survivor.
In b.g., the Pequod's burning bow sinks from sight.
Ishmael looks toward the horizon...but the ship is
gone. Nothing but black smoke and a empty sea.
Ishmael can't hold on much longer. His grip on
the oar weakens...
Out of the floating wreckage, Queequeg's coffin
pops up into view. Ishmael swims toward it and
hangs on for blessed life.
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
The blue wilderness of the deep. A pale corpse
sinks down into our view...Ahab, coiled in ropes,
dislodged harpoons floating around him. His dead
eyes open in cold, frozen rage...as he descends to
his watery grave.
In b.g., the great white whale streaks by.
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - SUNSET
A fiery sunset. Alone amidst an endless seascape,
Ishmael lies in the floating coffin. Exhausted
and parched, but alive.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
Saved by my friend's coffin,
I drifted on a soft, calm sea
for two days and a night...
On the dimming horizon, the faraway sails of a ship
drift into view.
ISHMAEL (V.O.)
(cont'd)
On the evening of the second
day, a whaling ship found me
at last. It was the Rachel,
still searching for her lost
son. Instead, she found
another orphan.
184
EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - DAY
The unbounded sea. A thousand leagues of blue.
On the calm, peaceful waters, a swell of bubbles...
MOBY DICK breaches -- leaping skyward out of the
sea in a triumphant arc! The majestic white whale
dives back down, his great flukes our last image.
Then he's gone.
FADE OUT.
THE END
